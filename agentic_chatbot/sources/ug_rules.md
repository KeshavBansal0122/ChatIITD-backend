to do additional elective courses under appropriate category to improve the DGPA within the maximum time
limit for completion of B.Tech. degree. In case a DGPA of 5.0 or more is achieved within the stipulated period,
a B.Tech. degree will be awarded and in case the same is not achieved no degree will be awarded and the
student may apply for a diploma.


(b) If a student completes requisite credits for Dual Degree Programme:


(i) with B.Tech. DGPA less than 5.0 but M.Tech. DGPA more than 6.0


The student will be permitted to do additional elective courses (under appropriate category) to
improve the DGPA for completion of B.Tech. part within the maximum time limit. In case a DGPA of
5.0 or more is achieved for B.Tech., the student will become eligible for award of the Dual Degree
(B.Tech. & M. Tech.) and in case the same is not achieved no degree will be awarded and the student
may apply for a diploma.


(ii) with B.Tech. DGPA more than 5.0 but M.Tech. DGPA less than 6.0


The student may opt to do additional elective courses (PE category only) to improve the DGPA within
the maximum time limit. If no programme elective (PE) courses are available, other relevant 700 and
800 level courses as approved by the department can be done for the purpose of improving the DGPA.
In case DGPA of 6.0 or more is achieved for the M.Tech. part, the student will be eligible for award of
the Dual Degree (B.Tech. & M.Tech.). However, in case the same is not achieved at the end of the
stipulated period, the student will be eligible for the award of only B.Tech. degree, provided a written
request for the same is made to the Dean, Academics.


(iii) with B.Tech. DGPA less than 5.0 and M.Tech. DGPA less than 6.0

within the maximum time limit. If no programme elective courses are available, relevant 700 and 800
level courses as approved by the department can be done for the purpose of improving the DGPA of
the M.Tech. part. In case a DGPA of 5.0 or more for B.Tech. and 6.0 or more for M.Tech. are achieved,
the student will be eligible for award of the Dual Degree (B.Tech. & M.Tech.). However, in case a DGPA
5.0 or more for B.Tech. is achieved but the DGPA of 6.0 or more for M.Tech. is not achieved at the end
of stipulated period, the student will be eligible for award of only B.Tech. degree provided a written
request for the same is made to the Dean, Academics.


(c) A student may be permitted to do additional elective courses under appropriate elective categories for
improving DGPA, even if he/she satisfies all graduation requirements. The student may be permitted to
register for courses in the additional semesters, up to the maximum limit in terms of registered semesters for
improving his/her DGPA provided a request for the same is made to the Dean, Academics within 15 days of

(d) A B.Tech. student is eligible to apply for a Diploma provided he/she has earned 100 credits and has exhausted
the maximum number of permitted registered semesters for completion of his/her degree. If the student has
completed 50 credits (out of 100 credits) from his/her DC+DE+PC+PE categories then the student will be
awarded ‘Undergraduate Diploma in the respective discipline’ on completion. If the student has not completed
50 credits from these categories but has completed 100 credits then he/she will be awarded ‘Undergraduate
Diploma in Engineering’. The Diploma is not equivalent to an undergraduate degree.


(e) No self-study course will be permitted for the purpose of improvement of DGPA.


**1.2.4 Audit Courses**


Audit facility is open to all undergraduate (B.Tech./Dual Degree) students who have 85 Earned Credits. A student
will be permitted to do any number of audit courses over and above the graduation requirements. The audit limits
for graduation are:


(a) B.Tech. (4-year) programme: A maximum of 8 credits from the elective courses in any category out of the
total credits required for B.Tech. degree may be completed on audit basis.


(b) Dual-degree programme: A maximum of 8 credits from the elective courses in any category may be completed
on audit basis from the UG part of the programme.


(c) A student earns either an NP (audit pass) or an NF (audit fail) grade for an audit course. The audit pass (NP)
grade may be awarded if the student satisfies the attendance criteria specified for the course and he/she
has obtained at least a ‘D’ grade. The course coordinator can specify a higher criterion for audit pass at the
beginning of the semester. If either of these requirements is not fulfilled, the audit fail (NF) grade is awarded.


(d) Grades obtained in an audit course are not considered in the calculation of SGPA or CGPA.


**1.3 Non-graded Core Requirement**


As part of the curriculum, non-graded units have been prescribed as core requirements for the undergraduate
degree. These units can be earned through a combination of formal academic activities and informal co-curricular
or extra-curricular activities. The components of non-graded core requirement are listed in Table 3.


_**Table 3: Components of Non-Graded Core Requirement for B.Tech. and Dual Degree***_

||**_Total_**|**_11_**|**_11_**|



***** **NGU in case of B.Des. programme will be updated later.**


The 11 units listed in Table 3 will be core requirement for students of all undergraduate programmes with entry
year 2020 or later. A student must earn these 11 units over the complete duration of the programme with special
requirements for each component as explained in Section 4. A student must get ‘S’ grades to earn these units.
Incomplete performance in these components will be indicated by a ‘Z’ grade.


For components 3-6 in the above table, a special portal called the NGU portal is used for necessary approvals and
posting of “S” grades. This portal can be accessed at _https://ngu.iitd.ac.in/index_


A brief description of the six components is given below. For complete details, please refer to Section 4.


**(a)** **Introduction to Engineering and Programme (NIN100) (1 unit)**


This course will introduce the students to the vast domain of Engineering in general with a glimpse of the


3


Courses of Study 2024-2025 **Undergraduate Programme Rules**


specifics of various engineering disciplines. All students will be required to register for this course in the first
semester for earning 1 unit. These may involve listening to guest lectures, interaction with distinguished
alumni, simple product building and product dissection exercises, executing simple design thinking exercises,
visit to laboratories (in and outside the Institute) and industry.


**(b)** **Language and Writing Skills (NLN100 and NLN101) (2 units)**

All students will be required to participate in Task-Based Language Learning (TBLL) exercises in the first
year, through two core courses: NLN100 in first semester and NLN101 in second semester. These language
games are designed to enhance their linguistic capabilities in comprehension, both reading and listening, as
well as improve their ability to structure and compose ideas in spoken and written communication. Wherever
necessary principles of English Grammar will be discussed along with the nuances of technical writing. The
Language Needs of a particular class of students will be assessed through an initial language test at the
beginning of the first semester. Then, the exercises will be tailored according to the specific language needs
of the particular class of students. These exercises could be scheduled during normal academic hours or
outside. Based on the performance and regularity, a student may be prescribed additional self-learning
exercises and practice sessions during vacations as well, as requirement for securing an ‘S’ grade.


**(c)** **NCC/NSO/NSS (NCN100/NSN100/NPN100) (Minimum 1 and Maximum 2 units)**


NCC/NSO/NSS also form part of the core requirement of the degree. Students will be required to earn at
least 1 unit from these activities involving 40 hours of work and a maximum of 2 units for 80 hours of work
towards the total NGU requirement.


**(d)** **Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility (PESR) (Minimum 1 and Maximum 2 units)**


There is increasing consensus worldwide that professional ethics need to be incorporated into the engineering
curriculum to provide students exposure to the kind of professional and ethical dilemmas they might face on
an individual basis as well as the larger ethical aspects of technology development. Workshops, discussions/
debates will be organized to sensitize students about Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility (PESR).
This component has 3 core courses: NEN110 in first semester, NEN111 in 2nd semester and NEN300 after
3rd year corresponding to a total of 1 unit. Students can earn an extra unit through additional activities,
such as PESR workshops (NEN212) and PESR projects (NEN213). For more details, please see Section
4.4.


**(e)** **Communication Skills/Seminar (1 unit)**


Communication Skills is an essential requirement for a modern engineer. As a part of the degree
requirements, undergraduate students will have to earn 1 unit in communication skills by registering for a
seminar course or an equivalent activity. Please see Section 4.5 for details.


**(f)** **Design and Practical Experience (Minimum 3 and Maximum 5 units)**


The objective of this non-graded core requirement component is to give opportunities to students to acquire
substantial design and practical experience both as a part of formal courses as well as in an informal setting.
Second and even more important objective of this course is to inculcate design thinking among students and
facilitate gaining some design immersion experience. Design and Practical Experience (DPE) component
is introduced to promote learning by doing which does two important things: it allows students to immerse
themselves in the environment in which work is to be done, so that they can understand the values and
expectations of the target beneficiaries. Secondly, it enables a fresh look at problems, not only at the ways
of defining them, but also at the ways to solve those including skill-sets that are required to address them.
A shift from problem-based learning (acquisition of knowledge) to project-based learning (application of
knowledge), where the projects are grounded in problems outside the classrooms and labs in everyday
scenarios, will involve students in reality, and reality in education. Design and Practical Experience bridges
division between the curricular and the co-curricular and encourages curiosity and involvement that arise
out of total absorption in a subject of interest. Non-graded units in Design and Practical Experience can
be earned through one or more of the following:


    - Specialized Elective Courses related to Design and Practical Experience (Maximum 2 Units)


    - Regular Courses with optional Design and Practical Experience Component (Maximum 2 Units)


    - Summer/winter/semester/SURA/DISA projects with Institute faculty, not evaluated for earning credits
(Maximum 2 units)


4


**Undergraduate Programme Rules** Courses of Study 2024-2025


    - Co-curricular projects such as Robocon, SAE-minibaja, etc. (Maximum 2 Units)


    - Summer Internships with Industry (Maximum 2 Units)


    - One Semester Internship (Maximum 5 Units)


    - Workshop Module on Design and Practical Experience offered by Faculty/Visitors (1 Unit each)


    - Section 4.6 gives complete details for this component.


**1.4 Minimum and Maximum Durations for Completing Degree Requirements**


(a) The minimum and maximum permitted duration of each academic programme will be determined in terms
of number of registered regular semesters, hereinafter called registered semesters. Any semester in which
a student has registered for a course will be called a registered semester subject to the following:


(i) Only the First and Second semesters of an academic year can be registered semesters. The summer
semester will not be counted as a registered semester.


(ii) A semester when a student has been granted semester withdrawal or granted semester leave will not
be considered as a registered semester.


(iii) The semester when a student is suspended from the Institute on disciplinary grounds will not be counted
towards the number of registered semesters.


(iv) A semester in which a student is allowed by the Institute to undergo semester - long internship will be
counted as a registered semester.


The summer semesters shall normally be available for earning credits. However, after the student has
registered for the maximum permissible number of registered semesters, the subsequent summer semesters
will not be available for earning credits.


(b) The minimum and maximum permissible number of registered semesters for completing all degree
requirements are defined in Table 4.


_**Table 4: Minimum and Maximum permissible duration for completing degree requirements.**_

|Programme Name|Minimum Number of<br>Registered Semesters|Maximum Number of Registered Semesters<br>Permitted for Completing Degree Requirements|
|---|---|---|
|B.Tech.|8|12*|
|B.Des.|8|12*|
|Dual Degree|10|14*|
|*If a student opts for the slow-paced programme, then the maximum permissible number of registered semesters shall be<br>increased by two semesters.|*If a student opts for the slow-paced programme, then the maximum permissible number of registered semesters shall be<br>increased by two semesters.|*If a student opts for the slow-paced programme, then the maximum permissible number of registered semesters shall be<br>increased by two semesters.|



**1.5 Absence During the Semester**


(a) A student must inform the Dean, Academics immediately of any instance of continuous absence from classes.


(b) A student who is absent due to illness or any other emergency, up to a maximum of two weeks, should
approach the course coordinator for make-up quizzes, assignments and laboratory work.


(c) A student who has been absent from a minor test due to illness should approach the course coordinator for
a make-up test immediately on return to class. The request should be supported with a medical certificate
from Institute’s medical officer. A certificate from a registered medical practitioner will also be acceptable
for a student normally residing off-campus provided registration number of the medical practitioner appears
explicitly on the certificate.


(d) In case a student misses a minor test on the same day on which he / she has appeared in another test, a
medical certificate from the institute’s medical must be submitted.


(e) In case of absence on medical grounds or other special circumstances, before or during the major examination
period, the student can apply for ‘I’ grade. At least 75% attendance in a course is necessary for being eligible
for request of I-grade in that course. An application requesting I-grade should be made at the earliest but not


5


Courses of Study 2024-2025 **Undergraduate Programme Rules**


later than the last day of major tests. An online application should be made by the student. On submission
of a medical certificate / Dean’s permission, the Academic Section verifies the certificate and forwards the
request to the concerned course coordinator. The course coordinator verifies the attendance requirement and
forwards the application to the Head of the Department / Centre / School of the student’s programme. Head’s
approval is contingent upon the satisfaction of attendance requirement. On approval, an ‘I’ grade is awarded
to the student. All evaluation requirements for students with ‘I’ grade should be completed before the end of
the first week of the next semester. Upon completion of all course requirements, the ‘I’ grade is converted to
a regular grade (A to F, NP or NF).


(f) In case the period of absence on medical grounds is more than 20 working days during the semester, a student
may apply for withdrawal from the semester, i.e. withdrawal from all courses registered that semester. Such
application must be made as early as possible and latest before the start of the major tests. No applications for
semester withdrawal will be considered after the major tests have commenced. Dean, Academics, depending
on the merit of the case, will approve such applications. Partial withdrawal from courses registered in a
semester is not allowed.


(g) If a student is continuously absent from the institute for more than four weeks without notifying the Dean
Academics, his/her name will be removed from institute rolls.


**1.6 Conditions for Continuation of Registration, Termination/Re-start, Probation**
**and Warning**

During the first two registered semesters of an undergraduate(B.Tech./Dual Degree) programme, a student is
registered for a total of 34 credits, besides non-graded units. By the end of the first two registered semesters, not
including summer, a student is expected to earn a minimum number of credits (excluding non-graded units) as
specified in Table 5, in order to continue registration. If a student does not meet this criterion, his/her performance
is classified as “Poor Performance”, and he / she may opt to start the programme afresh, or else his/her registration
will be terminated. This option to re-start the programme is available to a student only once.


_**Table 5: Criteria for continuation at the end of second registered semester**_







|Description|Earned Credits<br>(excluding non-graded units)|Col3|Decision|

|Poor Performance|≤ 22|≤ 18|Restart (Once only) / Termination of<br>registration|


(a) If a student chooses to restart after the first two registered semesters, then his/her credits earned and
semesters registered will not be carried over. The re-start will be indicated on the transcript. The re-start will
be permitted only once. If at the end of two registered semesters after re-start, the earned credits are less
than or equal to 22 for GE / OBC or less than or equal to 18 for SC / ST / PD students, then the registration will
be terminated.


(b) Each student is expected to earn at least 12 credits in each registered semester with an SGPA greater than
or equal to 5.0. If the performance of a student at the end of any registered semester is below this minimum
acceptable level, then he / she will be placed on probation, a warning shall be given to him / her and intimation
sent to the parents.


(c) A student placed on probation shall be monitored, including mandatory attendance in classes, special tutorials
and mentoring. Mentoring would comprise structured guidance under a senior / postgraduate student.


(d) If the performance of a student on probation does not meet the criterion in item (b) in the following registered
semester, then the student would face termination, and will be permitted to register by the Dean, Academics only
if the department makes a favourable recommendation. The Head of the Department’s recommendation shall
be prepared after consultation with the student, and should include (i) feasibility of completing the programme
requirements, and (ii) identification of remedial measures for the problems leading to poor performance.


(e) A student on probation can register upto 18 credits in a semester. This can be relaxed in 8 [th] /10 [th] or later
registered semester for B.Tech. / Dual Degree students, respectively.

**Undergraduate Programme Rules** Courses of Study 2024-2025


**Slow-paced Programme**

(a) If a student has earned the minimum credits specified in Table 5 for continuation but has less than 28 Earned
Credits at the end of the first two registered semesters, he / she will be eligible to opt for the slow-paced
programme. A student opting for such a programme shall be permitted two additional registered semesters
for completing degree requirements as indicated in Table 4.


(b) In the slow paced programme, the upper limit for credits registered in a semester will be 18. A student in this
programme is expected to earn at least 9 credits with minimum SGPA of 5.0 in any semester, falling which
he / she will be issued a warning and placed on probation.


A student placed on probation would be monitored, including mandatory attendance in special tutorials and
mentoring.


If the performance of a student on probation does not meet the above criterion in the following registered
semester, then the student would face termination and will be permitted to register by the Dean Academics
only if the department makes a favourable recommendation. The Head of the Department’s recommendation
shall be prepared after consultation with the student, and should include (i) feasibility of completing the
programme, and (ii) identification of remedial measures for the problems leading to poor performance.

(c) The semester-wise schedule of the slow-paced programme shall be defined by the respective department
for each student.


**1.7 Scheme for Academic Advising of Undergraduate Students**


**Advising Scheme for Regular Students**


(a) There is a class committee for each entry year of all programmes. The class committee is responsible for
providing consistent and uniform academic advice to the entire batch of students.


(b) Class committee shall consist of a Chairperson, at least two faculty members of the department (one of
them will function as Convenor of the class committee) and elected student representatives (as per CAIC
constitution) including a student coordinator. All student coordinators of courses intended for the batch in a
given semester and special advisors of academically weak students will be permanent invitees to the class
committee. The faculty members in the class committee would be referred to as Faculty Mentors for the batch.


(c) A Chairperson appointed for each entry year of students by the Head of the Department shall be associated
with the batch till it graduates and will provide basic guidance for formulating course plan and electives for
the students of the batch.


(d) The Convenor of a class committee will be appointed in a year-specific fashion: for example, the Convenor of
the second year class committee would continue in the same position for 3 years, serving consecutive batches.


(e) Students can approach any class committee member for academic advice before registration. In other words,
all the three members of the class committee will have the functional role of mentor and local guardian for all
the students. In case of need for any exception and relaxation in rules or regulations pertaining to registration
of courses, the class committee Convenor will recommend and forward the request.


(f) The faculty members of the committee in consultation with the elected representatives of the students will
provide academic advice applicable to all the students in general. The class committee is also expected to
discharge following responsibilities:


(i) Considering mid-semester feed-back about courses running in the current semester.


(ii) Identifying electives for the subsequent semester.

(iii) Addressing issues related to scheduling and categorization of courses.

(iv) Organizing STIC events for the batch.


(g) The Class Committee Convenor with the support of student coordinator will organize at least one StudentTeacher Interaction Committee (STIC) event in each semester for interaction between class committee
members and all the students of the batch.

(h) The Chairman, Convenor and the other faculty members of first year class committee would be identified by
the department prior to the orientation of new students. During orientation, students and their parents will be
introduced to these class committee members.

**Advising Scheme for Academically Weak Students**

(a) The students on probation in each batch will be put under a special advisor, identified by the department,
who is expected to monitor the students on probation in a personalized manner. Normally, not more than 5-8
students would be assigned to a special advisor. Heads of Departments will appoint special advisors at the
beginning of an academic session.


(b) A meeting of the special advisors with Dean, Academics would be held at the beginning of each semester
for coordination of the advising process.


(c) A student on probation is expected to be in close contact with the advisor by meeting him / her at least once
every 3 weeks for the entire period during which the student continues to remain in probation. Special advisors
will be invitees to the class committee meetings.

(d) Special advisor in consultation with the parents and student counsellor, if required, will make a student-specific
academic plan. The special advisor is expected to:


    - Closely interact with the weak student and his / her parents


    - Formulate individualized academic plan


    - Manage and track counselling process of the student, if any, in coordination with the Associate Dean,
Student Welfare.


    - Approve their registration


    - Manage the recommendation / appeal for termination / continuation process in consultation with Head of
the Department and Dean, Academics.


(e) At the time of registration for a semester, the student meets his / her advisor if possible with parents, to:

   - Identify specific problems and ways to mitigate the same


   - Formulate academic plan and target(s) for the semester


   - Help Head of the Department in the processing of the student’s appeal against termination, if applicable


   - Approve the registration of the student online.

(f) The student being placed under probation for the first time may also meet the counsellor during this period,
if needed. The counsellor can provide professional help in identifying to resolving problems. Counsellors’
input will be available to the special advisor. During the add-drop period, the student, preferably along with
his / her parents, should come and meet the Counsellor.


(g) While considering any appeal from an academically weak student for continuation of his registration, the
Dean, Academics would consider the following:


(i) whether he/she has met his / her Advisor and Counsellor at the scheduled times on a regular basis and


(ii) whether he/she is regular in help sessions.


Registration of a student under probation will not be approved for the next semester if he/she does not
comply with the process of meeting the advisor and counsellor. He / she will then be required to withdraw
from the semester.


(h) A student on probation will not be permitted to contest for any position of responsibility. However, he / she will
be permitted to participate in extra-curricular activities in a restricted fashion only on specific recommendation
of his / her advisor.


An Institute level committee known as the Welfare Committee would monitor the entire operation of academic
advising for weak students. Functions of the Welfare committee include monitoring the performance of weak students
and making the final recommendations regarding termination/ continuation, restarting first year and slow-paced
programme requests. This committee would also evaluate the weak students based on the feed-back regarding

**Student Mentors**


(a) Each student will be assigned a student mentor from the same hostel and preferably from the same discipline
to mentor students on academic and extra-curricular activities and provide feed-back to the advisor and
counselor in case of weak students.


(b) There are individual incentives for good student mentors. Also, hostels performing well on mentoring benefit
in terms of points towards BSW trophy.


**1.8** **Capability Linked Opportunities for Undergraduate (B.Tech./Dual Degree) Students**

A student registering for 24 credits in each semester after first year and 26 in two semesters can complete a
maximum of 182 credits. Since the graduation requirement for 4-year B.Tech. programmes varies between 148-158
Earned Credits, it will be feasible for capable students to add value to their degrees by registering for additional
courses of their choice.


Students can make use of these additional credits in two blocks of 20 credits to opt for:


(a) Minor / Interdisciplinary Area Specialization


(b) Departmental Specialization


A student based on his / her performance and interest can choose either one on both. Successful completion of
minor area credits and / or departmental Specialization will be indicated on the degree.


When a student opts for a departmental specialization and / or a minor area, he / she can use 10 open category
credits (mandatory degree requirement) towards departmental specialization and/or minor area requirements. For
example, a student registered for B.Tech. (Chemical Engineering) and opting for minor area in Computer Science
and Engineering, can opt for courses prescribed for minor area in Computer Science and Engineering, as part of
mandatory 10 credits requirements under OC. He / she will need to do additional 10 credits in the minor area to be
eligible for Minor area specialization in the degree.


A student may not opt for either of the two but can do additional credits through open choice of courses. In case
a student cannot meet requirements of a minor area or departmental Specialization, additional credits earned by
the student over and above his / her degree requirement will be used for DGPA calculation and will be indicated
on his / her transcript.

A set of pre-defined courses of total 20 credits in a focus area comprises a Departmental Specialization if the
courses belong to the parent Department of an undergraduate programme, or a Minor / Interdisciplinary Area
Specialization if the courses belong to a different Department / Centre / School. Additional conditions and details of
individual specializations are given in UG Rules, Section 3.


If any course of a Minor / Interdisciplinary area overlaps with any core course (DC or PC category courses) or
elective course (DE or PE category courses) of the student’s programme, then credits from this course will not count
towards the minor area credit requirements, though this course may contribute towards satisfying the requirement
of the Minor / Interdisciplinary area. In such a case, the requirement of 20 credits must be completed by taking
other courses of the specialization.


The maximum number of credits per semester may be relaxed upto 28 by Dean, Acaemics for those students who
apply for capability-linked option through proper channel.


**1.9 Change of Programme at the End of the First Year**

### **2. CAPABILITY-LINKED OPTIONS FOR** **UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS**

As described in Common Rules, Section 1.8, students can make use of additional credits in two blocks of 20 credits
to opt for


(a) Minor/Interdisciplinary Area Specialization (b)   Departmental Specialization


A student based on his / her performance and interest can choose either one on both. Successful completion of
minor area credits and / or Interdisciplinary / Departmental Specialization will be indicated on the degree.


When a student opts for such a specialization and / or a minor area, he / she can use 10 open category (OC) credits
(mandatory degree requirement) towards the specialization and/or minor area requirements. For example, a student
registered for B.Tech (Chemical Engg.) and opting for minor area in Computer Science, can opt for courses prescribed
for the minor area, as part of mandatory 10 credits requirements under OC. He/she will need to do additional 10
credits for completing the Minor area requirements.

A set of pre-defined courses of total 20 credits in a focus area comprises a Departmental Specialization if the
courses belong to the parent Department of an undergraduate programme, or a Minor / Interdisciplinary Area
Specialization if the courses belong to a different Department / Centre / School. Additional conditions and details
are given in this section.


If any course of a Minor / Interdisciplinary area overlaps with any core course (DC or PC category courses) or elective
course (DE or PE category courses) of the student’s programme, then credits from this course will not count towards
the minor area credit requirements, though this course may contribute towards satisfying the requirement of the
Minor / Interdisciplinary area. In such a case, the requirement of 20 credits must be completed by taking other courses
of the Minor Area or Departmental / Interdisciplinary specialization. A student interested in opting for a Capabilitylinked option can register for the same online, on a first-come first served basis, after he / she completes at least
2 courses, preferably the core courses (wherever applicable) of the Minor Area / Interdisciplinary / Departmental

### **3. NON-GRADED CORE FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS**

In order to synergize formal academics with informal outside-class-room learning experience, mechanisms for
earning non-graded units have been introduced in the undergraduate curriculum in 2013. In order to earn these
units, a student will need to involve himself / herself in activities beyond the classroom engagements. For earning
1 unit a student will typically need to work for 2-3 hours per week (28-42 hours per semester) in on-campus
activities. In case of project/design / internship activities, the student engagement expected is typically 20 days
of work per non-graded unit. A student would not be allowed to earn credits as well as non-graded units for the
same effort. It is important that the efforts towards earning non-graded units should be distinct from that spent
on earning credits. Also, the effort for earning different components of the non-graded units should be distinct,
i.e., the same effort would not be evaluated for more than one non-graded component.


Non-graded core of the undergraduate curriculum comprises of the following components:

|S.No.|Components|Minimum NGUs for<br>Graduation|Maximum Countable<br>Towards Total of 11 NGUs|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Introduction to Engineering and Programme|1|1|
|2|Language and Writing Skills|2|2|
|3|Communication Skills/Seminar|1|1|
|4|NCC/NSO/NSS|1|2|
|5|Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility|1|2|
|6|Design and Practical Experience|3|5|
|**_Total_**|**_Total_**|**_ 11_**|**_ 11_**|



These 11 units form a compulsory graduation requirement for all the undergraduate (B.Tech. as well as Dual
degree) programmes. A student will need to earn these 11 units over the duration of the programme with special
consideration and requirements for each component as detailed in the following sections. Each component
would be constituted by one or more non-graded courses, and a student will need to get an ‘S’ grade in these
courses to earn the respective non-graded unit(s). Incomplete status in such courses will be indicated by a ‘Z’
grade. The student would be required either to repeat the course/activity or continue with the project/internship
until such time that the evaluating faculty member/committee is satisfied with the effort to award an ‘S’ grade.
No partial/ fractional units can be awarded. For example, if a particular activity carries 2 units, a student cannot
be awarded 1 unit or fractional units for incomplete work, but would need to repeat / complete the work to the
satisfaction of the evaluating faculty member/committee to become eligible for award of 2 units.

For components 3-6 in the above table, a special portal called the NGU portal is used for necessary approvals
and posting of “S” grades. This portal can be accessed at _https://ngu.iitd.ac.in/index_


**3.1 Introduction to Engineering and Programme**


This non-graded component is aimed at orienting and exciting students in the subject of engineering in general
and their respective disciplines in particular. The objectives of the component are:


    - Exposing students to “Engineering” as a profession that creates wealth for nations, and as a vehicle
for economic growth.


    - Exposing students to Science / Engineering as a medium through which one can address problems
facing the society including some of the grand challenges.


    - Excite students by enabling them to appreciate the role and enormous impact of research in science/
engineering on our day to day lives.


    - Enlighten students about the various career options available to them.


    - Make students aware of the issues involved in engineering a product, and help them appreciate why
the process of design and innovation leading to products and systems is both personally satisfying
and professionally rewarding.


    - Excite students about potential role models and successful alumni in engineering profession.


    - Motivate students to take up some co-curricular activities on their own during their stay in the Institute.


The activities to realize the above-mentioned objectives as part of this non-graded component include:


23


Courses of Study 2024-2025 **Undergraduate Programme Rules**


     - Understanding engineering through product dissection and reverse engineering. (The products given
to students to dissect could be physical in form or in the form of videos).


    - Screening of videos that bring out the strong relation between science/engineering and societal needs.


    - Conducting design and innovation contests among students.


    - Solving science / engineering design thinking exercises in the class.


    - Lectures by successful industrialists, alumni and entrepreneurs about their journey.


    - Exposure to successful research cases from the Institute and the impact of the same.


    - Exposure to successful products/innovations from the Institute which have reached people/industry/
society.


    - Some interesting demonstrations in laboratories.


    - Hands-on exercises in laboratories.


    - Industry visits.


    - Visits to on-going exhibitions in the city.


    - Do-it-yourself projects in teams.


    - Lectures by faculty, visitors, alumni on some exciting topics.


This non-graded unit is administered in the form of one non-graded course of one unit:


    NIN100 Introduction to Engineering and Programme in the first semester of the undergraduate
programme.

The course coordinator of NIN100 would be identified by the Dean Academics. Apart from the main coordinator,
each department offering a UG programme, will identify a departmental coordinator for this course. The
departmental coordinator will engage with students of their respective departments and will cover 30-35% of
the course.


It is necessary to get a satisfactory (S) grade in this course for completing the degree requirements. Attendance
would be one of the main criteria for evaluation. Apart from this, active participation and quiz-based evaluation
etc. would also be used as a basis to decide ‘S’ or ‘Z’ grade. The grades of NIN100 would be moderated by
Dean Academics


**3.2 Language and Writing Skills**

All students are required to participate in Task-Based language classes in the first two semesters. The language
needs of a particular batch of the students will be assessed through an online test before the classes begin in the
first semester. Then the exercises for different classes will be tailored to the language needs of those students.
In general, these exercises are designed to enhance linguistic capabilities in comprehension, both reading and
listening, as well as improve the ability to structure and compose ideas in spoken and written communication. Many
of them will be structured in the form of competitive games. Wherever necessary principles of English Grammar will
be discussed along with the nuances of technical writing. With respect to its content, some of the textual material
and lectures  will focus on the relationship between Engineering, Humanities and Social Sciences.


The two semesters of Language and Writing Skills is administered in the form of two courses, each of one unit:
NLN100 Language and Writing Skills–I in the first semester and NLN101 Language and Writing Skills–II in the
second semester. These courses are coordinated by faculty from the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences
and an S grade in both NLN100 and NLN101 is generally a prerequisite to register for most undergraduate courses
offered by the department of HSS. Assessment of a student towards S grade in each of these courses would
typically be on the basis of attendance, participation and performance in the exercises. A student could also be
prescribed self-learning exercises or additional practice sessions during vacations as requirement for securing S
grade. Student’s involvement, during regular semester, would typically be two hours per week. The grades of these
courses are moderated by the Dean Academics.


**3.3 NCC/ NSO/ NSS**

A student is required to choose one of NCC/NSO/NSS during the first semester, and complete the requirements
preferably within the first four registered semesters. Students will be required to earn a minimum of 1 non-graded
unit from one of these activities, by completing at least 40 hours of work. Students can earn upto 2 units by putting
in 80 hours of work. The faculty coordinators of NCC / NSO / NSS decide and announce the policies on earning
non-graded units in these activities from time to time.

**Undergraduate Programme Rules** Courses of Study 2024-2025


**3.4 Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility**


There is increasing consensus worldwide that engineering ethics should be incorporated into the engineering
curriculum to provide students with an exposure to the kind of professional ethical dilemmas they might face on
an individual basis as well as in the larger context of ethical aspects of technology development. Workshops,
discussion/ debates, use of theatre-in-education, case-study based approaches, etc. are often used for illustration
and discussion of engineering ethics. Such inputs could be provided in a stand-alone manner, integrated into
existing courses or both. The objective of this non-graded component is to sensitize students about Professional
Ethics and Social Responsibility (PESR) through a combination of the above-mentioned approaches, supplemented
by discussion fora and supplementary materials, to help students to become ethical professionals. A student
is required to complete minimum of 1 non-graded unit in this component through activities divided into 3 core
courses. The courses NEN110 and NEN111 together correspond to 0.5 non-graded unit and the course NEN300
also corresponds to 0.5 unit. Besides, the students can earn an additional unit through one of the two alternatives
NEN212/NEN213 as discussed below. Thus, the courses under PESR are:


i) NEN110 Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility – I (core)


ii) NEN111 Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility – II (core)


iii) One of the following two courses: (optional)


a. NEN212 PESR Workshops


b. NEN213 PESR Projects


iv) NEN300 Case Studies in Professional Ethics (core)


**Core Requirements**


NEN110 and NEN111 are compulsory for all students, and these courses involve interactive sessions of a group
of students with a resource person in the first and second semesters respectively. The student will earn 0.5 unit
by getting S grade in both these courses.


In NEN300 Case Studies in Professional Ethics, every student will work on at least two case studies related to
professional ethics, followed by discussions on the same, moderated by a resource person. The details on how
to select the case studies and the mode of discussions and their evaluation would be decided by the concerned
resource person. The student will earn 0.5 unit by getting an S grade in this course.


**Activities for Additional NGU**


The students can choose to earn 1 more NGU under PESR by participating in any one out of a large variety of
activities relevant to the core themes of PESR. With the considerable amount of flexibility allowed in the choice
of activities, each student desirous of earning this unit should be able to identify an activity of interest to him / her
under the purview of PESR. These activities have been divided into two broad categories, viz., (a) PESR workshops
(b) PESR projects, each of which corresponds to a separate course number NEN212 and NEN213 respectively.
After a student has got ‘S’ grades in NEN110 and NEN111, the student can register for NEN212 / NEN213.
‘S’ grade in any of these two courses will get the student 1 NGU.


**NEN212 PESR Workshops**


Under NEN212 (PESR Workshops), students can participate in one workshop of 5 days duration if the workshop is
held in person. These workshops are generally organized on campus by NRCVEE soon after major examinations
at the end of every semester. Alternatively, online workshops can be held with about 40 hours of engagement
through 2-3 hour sessions during the semester or during vacation period. These workshops are organized by
NRCVEE and would be conducted by resource persons from within or outside the Institute. These workshops could
be pertaining to any of the themes relevant to PESR and the in-person ones could be held during mid-semester
break / summer / winter vacation. The students must follow the procedure announced by the faculty coordinator
to register for a workshop. The ‘S’ grade for attending a workshop will be awarded only if the student attends all
sessions of the workshop on all the days for its full duration.


**NEN213 PESR Projects**


Under NEN213 (PESR Projects), the students can take up projects under the guidance of one or more faculty
members to make positive contribution to campus life. This could include promoting wholesome practices on
campus such as:


25


Courses of Study 2024-2025 **Undergraduate Programme Rules**


     - ethical practices particularly among students through specially directed efforts;


     - peer assistance for the students in need of help academically or otherwise;


     - sustainable practices on campus like resource conservation, waste management, use of renewable
resources and the like;


     - working on technology for a social cause etc.


This work could be done during a semester or mid-semester break or summer / winter vacation. The student
must submit a project proposal on the NGU portal, with explicit statement of deliverables, through his / her faculty
supervisor(s), for approval by the PESR coordinator. If the work is taken up in a team, each student’s share of
work must be defined in the proposal. It is expected that each student puts in at least 40 hours of effort in the
project. On completion of the project, the students should submit a completion request online along with a report
of the work done, again through the faculty supervisor, who should certify that each student has completed his / her
share of the deliverables and each student has put in at least 40 hours of work into the project.


If a student gets selected in one of the nation building initiatives organized by reputed organizations, the student
can identify a faculty supervisor who can be informed of the work done as part of these initiatives. On successful
completion of the work, the student can apply on the NGU portal for earning NEN213 units through the faculty
supervisor, who can certify the completion of the concerned activity.

**3.5 Communication Skills / Seminar**


The objective of this non-graded component is to provide the students with an opportunity to develop their skills
in preparing write-ups, making presentations, and reading / listening to others’ write-ups / presentations. A student
would be required to earn 1 non-graded unit under this component between 5th and 8th semesters through any
of the following:

(i) Attending one of the topic specific seminar courses (XXQ301, XXQ302, etc.) introduced by the parent
Department of a student (for example ELQ301 – Seminar on Embedded Systems – 1 unit) or attending
a seminar course (XYQ301, XYQ302 etc.) offered by any other Department / Centre / School. These
courses would be non-credit electives, offered in each semester. These seminar sessions would be
held for two hours per week. Many such courses could run in parallel.


(ii) Participating in optional seminars which may be part of regular courses; for example regular ‘L’ courses
can have an optional seminar component (e.g. ELL711 Optical Communications can have optional
seminar component of 1 unit). This would, like any other seminar course, need to have seminar sessions
of 2 hours duration every week for a whole semester. In such a case, a student should register for
XXQ30y, and the course coordinator would send recommendations for ‘S’ grades to the Dean Academics,
duly moderated by the Moderation Committee of the concerned Department / Centre / School.


(iii) By participating in special workshops on Communication Skills approved by Dean Academics. The
faculty coordinator in charge of the workshop would submit a list of students who completed the activity
with 100% attendance in all sessions on all days of the workshop for award of ‘S’ grade in NQN301.

(iv) By submitting documentary evidence of excellence in debating and / or writing as certified by faculty
in-charge of these activities, to the Dean, Academics. In all such cases, the student should submit
documentary evidence online, as detailed below:


        A student who wins first, second or third position in any event / competition conducted at inter-hostel
level, by BRCA or by BSP or by BSW would qualify for this option. The event / competition must


27


Courses of Study 2024-2025 **Undergraduate Programme Rules**


be either a debate / declamation / extempore. Since many such events do not have certificates
issued, the student must submit a letter signed by the warden or the president of the respective
board (in case of BRCA, president of the club would also suffice) stating the date, time, venue
of the event / competition along with the number of participants and position secured. In case
number of participants is less than 20, the event shall not be counted.


        - A student who performs as a compere for any of the Institute functions (only those listed in the
Institute calendar). The student will need to produce a signed letter from the faculty in-charge
of the Institute function stating the student’s role as compere. The letter must include the date,
time, venue and duration of the event. Any event lasting less than 1 hour will not be counted.


        - A student winning a technical paper presentation award during TRYST will need to submit a copy
of the certificate and the abstract of the paper presented. Technical publications in Journals or
Conferences would also be considered, provided (i) the number of authors of the paper does not
exceed 2 and (ii) the faculty member supervising the work certifies that the paper was written by
the concerned student.


A minimum of three such documents certified by the faculty in charge of the Board / Club / Activity as mentioned above
would qualify a student to earn one unit of Communication Skills / Seminar. In each case, before recommending the
award of non-graded units for the above activities, the faculty in charge of the Board / Club / Activity should keep in
mind that a student engagement / effort (including preparations and the actual event) of about 40 hours would be
necessary for the award of one non-graded unit.


In cases of options (i), and (ii) above, the faculty member in charge of the course should ensure that the student
has 100% attendance in the seminars and has done a satisfactory task of his / her contribution to the course: the
write-up, presentation, etc. before awarding an ‘S’ grade. These grades would be moderated by the respective
Department / Centre / School. In case of unavoidable absence of up to 3 seminar sessions, appropriate compensation
mechanism should be announced by the faculty member at the beginning of the course. For absence beyond 3
sessions, S grade cannot be awarded.


An Institute level Coordinator for Communication Skills / Seminar, appointed by the Dean Academics, would serve
as the course coordinator of NQN301. An Institute level committee would moderate the non-graded units for
Communication Skills / Seminar recommended for activities other than the courses XXQ30y.


**3.6 Design / Practical Experience**


The objective of this non-graded component is to give opportunities to students to learn in an informal setting.
This mode of learning, is often more effective than conventional lectures / laboratory work. Second and even
more important objective of this non-graded component is to inculcate design thinking among students and
facilitate them to gain some design immersion experience. Design / Practical Experience (DPE) component can
promote learning by doing which does two important things: Firstly, it allows students to immerse themselves
in the environment in which work is to be done, so that they can understand the values and expectations of the
target beneficiaries. Secondly it enables a fresh look at problems, not only at the ways of defining them, but also
at the ways to solve those including skill-sets that are required to address them. This approach signifies a shift
from problem based learning (acquisition of knowledge) to project based learning (application of knowledge),
in which the projects are grounded in problems outside the classrooms and laboratories, in everyday scenarios.
Thus, DPE bridges division between the curricular and the co-curricular components, and encourages the curiosity
and involvement that arises from total absorption in a subject of interest.


As a part of this requirement, every student is expected to earn a minimum of three non-graded units of DPE to
complete the degree requirements. To earn one unit of DPE, a student is expected to put in 28-42 hours of effort
or 20 working days depending on the type of activity. To earn two units of DPE, a student needs to put in 56-84
hours of effort or 40 working days depending on the nature of activity. These units can be earned in multiple
ways during the semester as well as during vacation and mid-semester breaks:


    - Courses with design focus without any regular graded credits, which are designated to give design /
practical experience units.


    - Courses (core or elective) with optional design / practical experience component.


    - Summer / semester internships by students in R&D / Industry / Universities in India or abroad.


28


**Undergraduate Programme Rules** Courses of Study 2024-2025


    - Summer / winter / semester projects under the guidance of faculty of the Institute.


    - Participation in design /innovation projects by Innovation Center / CAIC, etc.


    - One time activity such as design /practical experience workshop /course /event during semester /
vacation /mid-semester breaks, etc.


DPE activities are not restricted to design of physical products but can also include system level design and
experience. For example a team of students who under the supervision of faculty in collaboration with an NGO,
would like to design a new financial inclusion system for marginalized section of population too can earn design /
practical experience units.


The operational modalities of implementing the above-mentioned activities so that students can earn the required
non-graded units, are presented in the following paragraphs.


**3.6.1 Management of Non-graded DPE Units**


Each Department offering UG programme(s) would constitute a DPE Committee with a Departmental DPE
Coordinator to manage the non-graded Design /Practical Experience units.

a) The Departmental DPE Committee would coordinate with Office of Career Services (OCS) to identify
and vet industries for internships.


b) The committee would also examine other types of internships (in Universities, research laboratories,
start-ups etc.) requested by students and approve or deny as per a policy defined by the Department.


c) Students of the Department desirous of earning non-graded DPE units through any other mechanism
listed above should request permission of this committee before embarking on the activity. The
committee would also decide on the award of non-graded DPE units for all such activities for the
students of the Department through appropriate evaluation mechanisms.


d) The committee would be responsible to evaluate the design activities carried out by the students during
internships and recommending award of the non-graded DPE units, or continuation of the internship
activity for more days to become eligible for the units, as per the efforts of the students during the
internship. DPE Committee will moderate all Design units awarded to students of that Department. The
Departmental DPE Coordinator also has responsibility of ensuring that units earned by heterogeneous
activities meet the requirements in terms of learning efforts and experience.


e) The Dean Academics will appoint an Institute DPE Coordinator for Design / Practical Experience

units.


f) Departmental DPE Coordinators, Institute DPE Coordinator and Associate Dean AcademicsCurriculum together will form an institute level committee to moderate the non-graded units awarded
under interdisciplinary work including the activities carried out by students in Departments / Centers /
Schools not offering UG programmes. This committee would also review and modify policies as well
as modalities for administering DPE units.


**3.6.2 Activities Covered Under Design / Practical Experience**


**3.6.2.1 Specialized Courses Related to Design / Practical Experience (Maximum 2 Units)**


Departments / Centres / Schools may offer a basket of courses that will not have any credits associated with them
but will have only Design / Practical Experience units linked to them. In other words, on successful completion of
such courses the students will earn only DPE units but no graded credits. These courses offered by Departments /
Centers / Schools can be of one unit (28-42 hours of student effort) or two units (56-84 hours of student effort).
Faculty offering these courses will award these units on successful completion of the course requirements,
and the same would be moderated by the Departmental Committee for DPE in case of Departments offering
undergraduate programmes. For other Departments / Centres / Schools, the moderation would be done by the
Institute level DPE committee.


**3.6.2.2 Semester / Summer / Winter Projects Under the Guidance of Institute Faculty (Maximum 2 Units)**


Some of the co-curricular activities in the Institute that pertain to team based product building such as Robotics,
Automobile, IGEM, Aero-modelling etc. can also be considered for earning DPE units. Students who successfully
complete SURA / DISA projects will also be eligible for DPE units. Besides, students may also opt for working on


29


Courses of Study 2024-2025 **Undergraduate Programme Rules**


semester / summer / winter projects involving design/practical experience activity under the guidance of faculty
of the institute. In order to be evaluated for DPE Units in such cases, a student should register for XXD35y Minor
Design Project floated by the parent Department XX of the student. In case the project is interdisciplinary or it
is offered by faculty of other Departments / Centres / Schools, the faculty supervisor of the project may advise
the students to register for NDN35y Minor Design Project. In either case, the project would be evaluated by
the faculty supervisor.


The courses XXD351 – XXD355 would be Minor Design Projects with 1 non-graded DPE unit, and XXD356
– XXD358 would be Minor Design Projects with 2 non-graded units each. Courses NDN351 – 358 would also
follow a similar definition.


**3.6.2.3 Regular Courses with Optional Design / Practical Experience Component (Maximum 2 Units)**


Course coordinators of regular core and elective courses can also offer optional design component in their
courses. A proposal for this should be sent to the Departmental DPE committee prior to the commencement of the
course by the Course Coordinator. This would be notified to students by the Departmental DPE committee and
also announced to the students by the course coordinator. Successful completion of the course will give graded
credits to students and at the same time they will be eligible for earning (1 or 2) design units if they successfully
complete the optional DPE component. The course coordinator will recommend these DPE units on successful
completion of the assigned work. This would be moderated by the Departmental Committee for DPE. In case the
course is offered by Departments / Centres / Schools which do not offer a UG programme, the notification prior
to beginning of the course and moderation after the end of the course would be done by the Institute level DPE
committee. In order to be evaluated for DPE Units, a student should register for XXD35y Minor Design Project
or NDN35y Minor Design Project as the case may be.


**3.6.2.4 Summer Internships (Maximum 2 Units)**


Students can undertake a minimum of 40 working days of internship to earn two design practical experience units
during summer vacations in Industry, R&D institutions or Universities in India or abroad. This cannot be earned in
parts. For example, 1 NGU cannot be claimed for 20 working days of internship. This would be administered by
the Departmental Committee for DPE with the help of the Office of Carrer Services (OCS). Students are required
to get approval for taking up internship in the concerned Institute through the NGU portal prior to proceeding
for the internship if they wish to claim NGU for the internship. The Departmental DPE Committee would also be
responsible for appointing a faculty supervisor for the internship. Students can proceed with the internship after
the Departmental Committee for DPE approves the same. Design units for the internship would be awarded by
the Departmental Committee after evaluation at the end of internship period. Rules governing administration of
internships are given in section 4.6.3. In case an internship pertains to areas of expertise outside those of the
parent Department, the DPE Committee may co-opt faculty members from other Departments / Centres / Schools
for evaluating / supervising such internships.


**3.6.2.5 One-Semester Internship (Maximum 5 Units)**


Students can opt for one semester internship in Industry, R&D institutions or Universities in India or abroad, for
a minimum of 100 working days, by appropriately planning for completion of credit requirements for the degree.
The student can also opt for a break in coursework for a semester to initiate or work for his / her start up. These
are the only two activities upon successful completion of which students would be eligible for 5 DPE units. It is
mandatory that student’s work during the one-semester internship is supervised by two mentors, one from the
institute (appointed by the DPE Committee of the student’s Department) and another from the host organization.
In case of semester break for a start-up, students will work under the mentorship of a faculty member of the
Institute. Students desiring to opt for one semester internship or semester break for start-up as mentioned
above are required to plan well in advance and submit a project proposal in consultation with their supervisors
(in case of internship) or faculty mentor (in case of start-ups). Students can proceed with the internship / startup
activity only after the Departmental Committee for DPE approves the same. DPE units for the activity would
be awarded by the Departmental DPE Committee after evaluation at the end of the internship / startup period.
In case an internship / startup pertains to areas of expertise outside those of the parent Department, the DPE
Committee may co-opt faculty members from other Departments / Centres / Schools for evaluating / supervising
such activities. Details of the procedure are given in section 3.6.3 on internships.


A semester in which a student earns DPE units through semester-long internship or start-up as discussed above
would be counted as a registered semester for graduation requirements. In case the DPE committee does not
approve the award of 5 units for such activity, the semester would not be counted as a registered semester.3

**3.6.2.6 One Time Design / Practical Experience Module (1 Unit)**


One time DPE modules can be offered by Institute faculty as well as working professionals who would like to
engage students in a workshop / course related to design / practical experience. A proposal for such a module
should be sent by faculty member coordinating the course through the concerned Department / Centre / School
to the Institute DPE Committee for approval. These modules can be typically of 28-42 hours duration, and
may be offered during mid-semester breaks, winter / summer vacations and even during non-class hours
in the semester.


Table 3.3 summarizes the information presented in section 3.6.2. Detailed rules pertaining to internships
and their administration are given in section 3.6.3.

   - A student cannot register for more than 3 non-graded DPE units per summer semester or per registered
semester in which a student is on regular academic activity. To take part in activities that can result in
more than 3 DPE units, a student has to take the semester off from regular courses.


   - A single activity cannot be evaluated for more than one purpose. For example, the same project cannot
be submitted for graded credits as well as for design units.


**3.6.3 Rules Governing Internship**


i) Internships for DPE units are permitted only in one of the two following formats:


a. Summer internship of 40 days duration, in which a student can earn 2 DPE units.


b. Semester-long internship of 100 days duration, in which a student can earn 5 DPE units.


No other format of internship would be considered for the award of DPE units. DPE units would be
awarded only if training for the stipulated number of working days, as mentioned above, is completed
to the satisfaction of the concerned Departmental DPE Committee. DPE units would not be awarded
against partial completion of the internship duration.


ii) A student can choose from one of the following options in order to complete the requirements of NonGraded component of Design / Practical Experience:


a. One semester internship, accounting for 5 DPE units.


32


**Undergraduate Programme Rules** Courses of Study 2024-2025


b. One summer internship, accounting for 2 DPE units and 1 to 3 DPE units from other activities at
the Institute


c. Two summer internships, accounting for a total of 4 DPE units, and if desired, 1 DPE unit from
other activities at the Institute


d. No internships: all DPE units can be earned through design / project activities at the Institute


iii) A student can do at most two internships for DPE units, during his/her stay at the Institute. If any student
does more than two internships, DPE units will be awarded for the first two registered internships only.


iv) Summer internships are allowed in the summer after the 4th registered semester of the student or later.
Semester Internships are permitted from the 7th registered semester or later.


v) Internships are permitted in industry, research laboratories or academic institutions involved in research,
development and / or technology transfer. Any student opting for semester long internship may also be
allowed to work on a start-up. All internships must be approved by the departmental DPE committee in
advance. In the case of non-industry internships, the work should be research / development / practice
oriented, and not classroom course work.


vi) In all cases, for award of DPE units, after completion of the internship, the work must be evaluated by
the DPE committee of the student’s Department. In case the work is found wanting in any respect, the
student(s) will be advised to do more work and reappear before the committee. In any case, partial
award of DPE units would not be allowed.


vii) For self-arranged internships, any documentation regarding the bona fide status of students (while
applying for training) will be provided by UG section.


**3.6.3.1 Registration Procedure for Internships**


**Summer Internships:**

i) At the beginning of first semester of each academic year, the data of all students who have earned at
least 30 credits would be automatically enrolled by the OCS for internship in the subsequent summer.


ii) At the beginning of the internship in the following summer, the student must have completed 50 credits
to be eligible.


iii) OCS sends out information to the students about the companies offering summer internships. Interested
students can apply for the same.


iv) The students can also arrange for the internships on their own.


v) If a student is selected for an internship through OCS, he/she is bound to accept the internship. If
the student does not take up or complete the internship, he/she will be debarred from all further OCS
activities including further internship opportunities and placement procedure. This is to discourage
non-serious students from depriving other students of the opportunity, and damaging the reputation of
IIT Delhi with the companies offering internships through OCS.

vi) The OCS would handle correspondences and training certificates of all internships arranged by the
OCS.


vii) OCS will try and arrange internships for as many students as it can. However, it may not be possible
for the OCS to arrange internships for all the students who participate in the process.


viii) The OCS typically starts the process of selections for internships in August and ends in February- March.
The exact dates would be notified by the OCS each year.


ix) To claim DPE units for summer internships, a student is required to initiate activity XXT200 or XXT300
on the NGU portal prior to the commencement of the internship. A student should register in XXT200
if it is his/her first summer internship and XXT300 if it is second summer internship. The approval of
initiation request will be as per the rules and regulations of the academic unit, which holds for both
OCS arranged as well as self-arranged internships.

x) At the end of summer internship, a student is required to submit training report and training certificate
to the department DPE coordinator. Further, student will also need to raise the completion request for
the registered activity XXT200/300. DPE units will be awarded after the due evaluation procedure of
the respective academic unit.


33


Courses of Study 2024-2025 **Undergraduate Programme Rules**


**Semester Internship:**


i) Semester internship, as mentioned in section 3.6.2.5, is permitted in the seventh registered semester
or later, for students with at least 75 earned credits.


ii) A student needs to submit a request on the NGU portal for prior approval of semester internship. The
request for internship will be evaluated by the DPE committee of the student’s parent Department and
approved by the Institute DPE committee upon recommendation of the former.


iii) Process of monitoring / mentoring the internship is described in section 3.6.2.5. Upon completion, the
student should submit a request on the NGU portal for approval of the completion of the internship
through the supervisor and Departmental DPE committee to the Institute DPE committee. The grade
for semester internship is awarded by the Institute DPE committee.


The list of courses offered in connection with non-graded units listed in sections 3.1-3.6 along with the respective
pre-requisites is summarized in Table 3.4.

**3.7 Overlapping Activities**


Many of the activities listed under a given component in sections 3.1-9.6 could also qualify as valid activities
under other non-graded components: for example, a technical project done as part of NEN213 may qualify to be
submitted for DPE units under XXD35y, etc. Some of the technical projects may also qualify as valid activities under
Minor / Mini / Major projects towards earning graded credits. In this regard, the following would be strictly followed:
In case a project is evaluated for graded credits or for any other non-graded activity, it would not be allowed to
be re-submitted for any other non-graded unit. While submitting the completion request of the project online, a
student should submit an undertaking to this effect, approved online by the faculty supervisor of the project.


a) In the summer when student has registered for Summer Internship (either through OCS or self-arranged);
they cannot be registered for any course or other institute activity.


b) Additional work which is not evaluated for such projects, either done prior to such projects or done after
the completion of such projects, could be considered. In such a case, prior written permission must be
taken from the concerned committee (PESR, DPE, etc.), explicitly describing components of work being
submitted for the other graded / non-graded evaluations and for the current submission separately. In

The workshops organised by NSS and under NEN212 would be generally distinct. Under NEN212,

Workshops organized by NSS would not be counted for NEN212 and vice-versa.
