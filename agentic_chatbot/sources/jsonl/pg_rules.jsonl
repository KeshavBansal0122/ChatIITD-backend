The\nDepartments / Centres / Schools may stipulate a larger number of credits in general or in specific cases. The\ncourse requirement will be determined by the Department / Centre / School Research Committee (DRC / CRC / SRC)\non the recommendations of the supervisor after due consideration of the background of the student in relation\nto the proposed topic of research. These courses can be prescribed from existing M.Tech. courses and / or\nfrom special pre-Ph.D. courses including laboratory, seminar, foreign language, etc. Normally, no independent\nstudy course will be allowed for Ph.D. students. The pre-Ph.D. course credits that contribute to the DGPA of the\nResearch Scholar can only be earned from regular lecture courses. In exceptional cases for Research Scholars\nwho join the Ph.D. programme after B.Tech. (or equivalent) degree, a maximum of one course may be allowed\nhaving laboratory or programming content only. Such an exception would be allowed by the Dean, Academics\non recommendation of the SRC of the student and the corresponding DRC / CRC.\nFurther, in case a Ph.D. student having completed 15 credits is unable to complete the research at the Ph.D.\nlevel for any reason whatsoever, he / she may be allowed to complete M.S.
