{"section": "1.1 Background", "content": "IIT Delhi offers various Undergraduate, Post Graduduate and Ph.D. Programms at the undergraduate level, IIT\nDelhi provides science-based engineering education with a view to produce quality engineer-scientists. Every\nB.Tech. student needs to do compulsory foundation courses in the areas of basic sciences, humanities, social\nsciences and engineering sciences apart from departmental requirements in his/her core engineering discipline.\nDepartmental courses (core and electives) constitute about half of the total curriculum. Further, students do\nopen category electives to develop broad inter-disciplinary knowledge base or to specialize significantly in\nan area outside the parent discipline. Many activities are included in the undergraduate curriculum as nongraded core with a view to enhance the quality of learning. The curriculum provides broad based knowledge\nand simultaneously builds a temper for a lifelong process of learning and exploring. At present, IIT Delhi offers\n14 B.Tech., 3 Dual Degree (integrated B.Tech. and M.Tech.), and 1 B.Des. programmes.\nIIT Delhi also offers multiple Postgraduate Programmes (M.Sc./M.Tech./M.S.(Research)/M.Des./M.B.A./M.P.P./M.A./\nPh.D.) through its Departments, Centres, and Schools. Currently, there are 37 M.Tech., 8 Interdisciplinary M.Tech., 18\nM.S.(R.), 6 M.Sc., 1 M.Des., 3 M.B.A. (including part time), 1 M.P.P., 1 PG Diploma, and 31 Ph.D. programmes offered\nby different academic units. In addition, there are 2 joint Ph.D. and 1 joint PG Diploma programmes being offered in\ncollaboration with partner institutions. The Institute has multiple courses at appropriate levels to cater to the academic\nrequirements of the Postgraduate students. New courses are also being continuously added to the existing pool of PG and\nPre-Ph.D. courses. At the postgraduate level, students are also encouraged to look beyond their area of specialization\nto broaden their horizons through open electives and self-learning.\nThe medium of instruction in the Institute is English.\nThe Institute follows a semester system. An academic year typically runs from July through June next year and is\nessentially comprised of two semesters. Typically, the 1 [st] semester starts in the last week of July and ends in the 1 [st]\nweek of December; the 2 [nd] semester starts in the 1 [st] week of January and ends in the 2 [nd] week of May. Additionally, the\nsummer semester which starts in the 3 [rd] week of May and ends in the 2 [nd] week of July, is utilized in some exceptional\ncases. Detailed schedule is given in the Semester Schedule that is made available before the start of each semester.", "url": "https://home.iitd.ac.in/uploads/General%20Information/CoS%202024__General%20Rules%20(1).pdf", "file": "cos_24_rules.json"}

Major Project. The minimum marks for award of \u2018D\u2019 grade is 30 %. However, individual course coordinators\nmay set a higher marks requirement.\n**E** and **F** grades\nA student who has scored at least 20% aggregate marks in a subject can be awarded an \u2018E\u2019 Grade. The Course\nCoordinators are, however, free to enhance this limit but should keep the percentage about 10% less than the\ncut-off marks for \u2018D\u2019 Grade. The Course Coordinators can also specify any additional requirements (to be specified\nat the beginning of the Semester) for awarding \u2018E\u2019 Grade.

An \u2018I\u2019 grade is awarded in case of absence on medical grounds or other\nspecial circumstances, before or during the major examination period, provided the student has met the attendance\ncriterion of the course. Attendance in the course for which \u2018I\u2019 grade is being sought will be certified by the course\ncoordinator of the course.\nThe course coordinators can instruct all students awarded \u2018I\u2019 grade as well as \u2018E\u2019 grade to appear for a common\nre-major test. All evaluation requirements for such students in the corresponding course(s) should be completed\nbefore the end of the first week of the next semester. Upon completion of all course requirements, the \u2018I\u2019 grade is\nconverted to a regular grade (A to F, NP or NF).\n**NP** and **NF** grades\nThese grades are awarded in a course that the student opts to audit.

The audit pass (NP) grade is awarded if the\nstudent\u2019s attendance is above 75% in the class and he/she has obtained at least \u2018D\u2019 grade. The course coordinator\ncan specify a higher criterion, at the beginning of the semester, for audit pass. If the stipulated requirements are\nnot fulfilled, the audit fail (NF) grade is awarded. The grades obtained in an audit course are not considered in the\ncalculation of SGPA, CGPA or DGPA. However, for undergraduate students, the credits will be counted in total\nearned credits in the respective category, subject to the maximum allowable limit for audit.\n**W** grade\nA \u2018W\u2019 grade is awarded in a course from which the student has opted to withdraw. Withdrawal from a course is\npermitted until the date specified in the Semester Schedule. Withdrawal from PG major project part 2 is allowed\nonly if he/she is given semester withdrawal.

Once the class attendance policy has been made clear to all the students registered for the course, the\nCourse Coordinator will implement the same in totality.\nFor the purpose of attendance calculation, every scheduled practical class will count as one unit irrespective of\nthe number of contact hours.\nAttendance record will be maintained based upon roll calls (or any equivalent operation) in every scheduled lecture,\ntutorial and practical class. Students are required to strictly adhere to and comply with any method or device\nemployed by the Course Coordinator / Instructor for purpose of Attendance Recording. Failure to do so may call for\ndisciplinary action. The course coordinator will maintain and consolidate attendance record for the course (lectures,\ntutorials and practicals together, as applicable).\nA Course Coordinator may choose any one or more of the following as attendance policy.\n(a) The Course Coordinator can assign 10% of the total marks to surprise quiz(zes). If attendance of\nthe student is greater than 90%, result of the best three quizzes will be considered, else average\nof all quizzes will be considered.\n(b) The Course Coordinator can allocate specific marks for participation in discussions in the class on\na regular basis.\n17\n(c) If a student\u2019s attendance is less than 75%, the student will be awarded one grade less than the actual\ngrade that he/she has earned.

A student must earn these 11 units over the complete duration of the programme with special\nrequirements for each component as explained in Section 4. A student must get \u2018S\u2019 grades to earn these units.\nIncomplete performance in these components will be indicated by a \u2018Z\u2019 grade.\nFor components 3-6 in the above table, a special portal called the NGU portal is used for necessary approvals and\nposting of \u201cS\u201d grades. This portal can be accessed at _https://ngu.iitd.ac.in/index_\nA brief description of the six components is given below. For complete details, please refer to Section 4.\n**(a)** **Introduction to Engineering and Programme (NIN100) (1 unit)**\nThis course will introduce the students to the vast domain of Engineering in general with a glimpse of the\n3\nCourses of Study 2024-2025 **Undergraduate Programme Rules**\nspecifics of various engineering disciplines. All students will be required to register for this course in the first\nsemester for earning 1 unit. These may involve listening to guest lectures, interaction with distinguished\nalumni, simple product building and product dissection exercises, executing simple design thinking exercises,\nvisit to laboratories (in and outside the Institute) and industry.\n**(b)** **Language and Writing Skills (NLN100 and NLN101) (2 units)**\nAll students will be required to participate in Task-Based Language Learning (TBLL) exercises in the first\nyear, through two core courses: NLN100 in first semester and NLN101 in second semester. These language\ngames are designed to enhance their linguistic capabilities in comprehension, both reading and listening, as\nwell as improve their ability to structure and compose ideas in spoken and written communication. Wherever\nnecessary principles of English Grammar will be discussed along with the nuances of technical writing. The\nLanguage Needs of a particular class of students will be assessed through an initial language test at the\nbeginning of the first semester. Then, the exercises will be tailored according to the specific language needs\nof the particular class of students. These exercises could be scheduled during normal academic hours or\noutside. Based on the performance and regularity, a student may be prescribed additional self-learning\nexercises and practice sessions during vacations as well, as requirement for securing an \u2018S\u2019 grade.\n**(c)** **NCC/NSO/NSS (NCN100/NSN100/NPN100) (Minimum 1 and Maximum 2 units)**\nNCC/NSO/NSS also form part of the core requirement of the degree. Students will be required to earn at\nleast 1 unit from these activities involving 40 hours of work and a maximum of 2 units for 80 hours of work\ntowards the total NGU requirement.\n**(d)** **Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility (PESR) (Minimum 1 and Maximum 2 units)**\nThere is increasing consensus worldwide that professional ethics need to be incorporated into the engineering\ncurriculum to provide students exposure to the kind of professional and ethical dilemmas they might face on\nan individual basis as well as the larger ethical aspects of technology development. Workshops, discussions/\ndebates will be organized to sensitize students about Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility (PESR).\nThis component has 3 core courses: NEN110 in first semester, NEN111 in 2nd semester and NEN300 after\n3rd year corresponding to a total of 1 unit. Students can earn an extra unit through additional activities,\nsuch as PESR workshops (NEN212) and PESR projects (NEN213). For more details, please see Section\n4.4.\n**(e)** **Communication Skills/Seminar (1 unit)**\nCommunication Skills is an essential requirement for a modern engineer. As a part of the degree\nrequirements, undergraduate students will have to earn 1 unit in communication skills by registering for a\nseminar course or an equivalent activity. Please see Section 4.5 for details.\n**(f)** **Design and Practical Experience (Minimum 3 and Maximum 5 units)**\nThe objective of this non-graded core requirement component is to give opportunities to students to acquire\nsubstantial design and practical experience both as a part of formal courses as well as in an informal setting.\nSecond and even more important objective of this course is to inculcate design thinking among students and\nfacilitate gaining some design immersion experience. Design and Practical Experience (DPE) component\nis introduced to promote learning by doing which does two important things: it allows students to immerse\nthemselves in the environment in which work is to be done, so that they can understand the values and\nexpectations of the target beneficiaries. Secondly, it enables a fresh look at problems, not only at the ways\nof defining them, but also at the ways to solve those including skill-sets that are required to address them.\nA shift from problem-based learning (acquisition of knowledge) to project-based learning (application of\nknowledge), where the projects are grounded in problems outside the classrooms and labs in everyday\nscenarios, will involve students in reality, and reality in education. Design and Practical Experience bridges\ndivision between the curricular and the co-curricular and encourages curiosity and involvement that arise\nout of total absorption in a subject of interest. Non-graded units in Design and Practical Experience can\nbe earned through one or more of the following:\n- Specialized Elective Courses related to Design and Practical Experience (Maximum 2 Units)\n- Regular Courses with optional Design and Practical Experience Component (Maximum 2 Units)\n- Summer/winter/semester/SURA/DISA projects with Institute faculty, not evaluated for earning credits\n(Maximum 2 units)\n4\n**Undergraduate Programme Rules** Courses of Study 2024-2025\n- Co-curricular projects such as Robocon, SAE-minibaja, etc. (Maximum 2 Units)\n- Summer Internships with Industry (Maximum 2 Units)\n- One Semester Internship (Maximum 5 Units)\n- Workshop Module on Design and Practical Experience offered by Faculty/Visitors (1 Unit each)\n- Section 4.6 gives complete details for this component.", "url": "https://home.iitd.ac.in/uploads/PG%20Programme%20Rules/CoS%202024__PG%20Programme%20Rules%20Changed.pdf", "file": "ug_rules.json"}

{"section": " 3. NON-GRADED CORE FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS", "content": "In order to synergize formal academics with informal outside-class-room learning experience, mechanisms for\nearning non-graded units have been introduced in the undergraduate curriculum in 2013. In order to earn these\nunits, a student will need to involve himself / herself in activities beyond the classroom engagements. For earning\n1 unit a student will typically need to work for 2-3 hours per week (28-42 hours per semester) in on-campus\nactivities. In case of project/design / internship activities, the student engagement expected is typically 20 days\nof work per non-graded unit. A student would not be allowed to earn credits as well as non-graded units for the\nsame effort. It is important that the efforts towards earning non-graded units should be distinct from that spent\non earning credits. Also, the effort for earning different components of the non-graded units should be distinct,\ni.e., the same effort would not be evaluated for more than one non-graded component.\nNon-graded core of the undergraduate curriculum comprises of the following components:\n|S.No.|Components|Minimum NGUs for<br>Graduation|Maximum Countable<br>Towards Total of 11 NGUs|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|1|Introduction to Engineering and Programme|1|1|\n|2|Language and Writing Skills|2|2|\n|3|Communication Skills/Seminar|1|1|\n|4|NCC/NSO/NSS|1|2|\n|5|Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility|1|2|\n|6|Design and Practical Experience|3|5|\n|**_Total_**|**_Total_**|**_ 11_**|**_ 11_**|\nThese 11 units form a compulsory graduation requirement for all the undergraduate (B.Tech. as well as Dual\ndegree) programmes. A student will need to earn these 11 units over the duration of the programme with special\nconsideration and requirements for each component as detailed in the following sections. Each component\nwould be constituted by one or more non-graded courses, and a student will need to get an \u2018S\u2019 grade in these\ncourses to earn the respective non-graded unit(s). Incomplete status in such courses will be indicated by a \u2018Z\u2019\ngrade. The student would be required either to repeat the course/activity or continue with the project/internship\nuntil such time that the evaluating faculty member/committee is satisfied with the effort to award an \u2018S\u2019 grade.\nNo partial/ fractional units can be awarded. For example, if a particular activity carries 2 units, a student cannot\nbe awarded 1 unit or fractional units for incomplete work, but would need to repeat / complete the work to the\nsatisfaction of the evaluating faculty member/committee to become eligible for award of 2 units.\nFor components 3-6 in the above table, a special portal called the NGU portal is used for necessary approvals\nand posting of \u201cS\u201d grades. This portal can be accessed at _https://ngu.iitd.ac.in/index_", "url": "https://home.iitd.ac.in/uploads/PG%20Programme%20Rules/CoS%202024__PG%20Programme%20Rules%20Changed.pdf", "file": "ug_rules.json"}
{"section": "3.1 Introduction to Engineering and Programme", "content": "This non-graded component is aimed at orienting and exciting students in the subject of engineering in general\nand their respective disciplines in particular. The objectives of the component are:\n- Exposing students to \u201cEngineering\u201d as a profession that creates wealth for nations, and as a vehicle\nfor economic growth.\n- Exposing students to Science / Engineering as a medium through which one can address problems\nfacing the society including some of the grand challenges.\n- Excite students by enabling them to appreciate the role and enormous impact of research in science/\nengineering on our day to day lives.\n- Enlighten students about the various career options available to them.\n- Make students aware of the issues involved in engineering a product, and help them appreciate why\nthe process of design and innovation leading to products and systems is both personally satisfying\nand professionally rewarding.\n- Excite students about potential role models and successful alumni in engineering profession.\n- Motivate students to take up some co-curricular activities on their own during their stay in the Institute.\nThe activities to realize the above-mentioned objectives as part of this non-graded component include:\n23\nCourses of Study 2024-2025 **Undergraduate Programme Rules**\n- Understanding engineering through product dissection and reverse engineering. (The products given\nto students to dissect could be physical in form or in the form of videos).\n- Screening of videos that bring out the strong relation between science/engineering and societal needs.\n- Conducting design and innovation contests among students.\n- Solving science / engineering design thinking exercises in the class.\n- Lectures by successful industrialists, alumni and entrepreneurs about their journey.\n- Exposure to successful research cases from the Institute and the impact of the same.\n- Exposure to successful products/innovations from the Institute which have reached people/industry/\nsociety.\n- Some interesting demonstrations in laboratories.\n- Hands-on exercises in laboratories.\n- Industry visits.\n- Visits to on-going exhibitions in the city.\n- Do-it-yourself projects in teams.\n- Lectures by faculty, visitors, alumni on some exciting topics.\nThis non-graded unit is administered in the form of one non-graded course of one unit:\nNIN100 Introduction to Engineering and Programme in the first semester of the undergraduate\nprogramme.\nThe course coordinator of NIN100 would be identified by the Dean Academics. Apart from the main coordinator,\neach department offering a UG programme, will identify a departmental coordinator for this course. The\ndepartmental coordinator will engage with students of their respective departments and will cover 30-35% of\nthe course.\nIt is necessary to get a satisfactory (S) grade in this course for completing the degree requirements. Attendance\nwould be one of the main criteria for evaluation. Apart from this, active participation and quiz-based evaluation\netc. would also be used as a basis to decide \u2018S\u2019 or \u2018Z\u2019 grade. The grades of NIN100 would be moderated by\nDean Academics", "url": "https://home.iitd.ac.in/uploads/PG%20Programme%20Rules/CoS%202024__PG%20Programme%20Rules%20Changed.pdf", "file": "ug_rules.json"}
{"section": "3.2 Language and Writing Skills", "content": "All students are required to participate in Task-Based language classes in the first two semesters. The language\nneeds of a particular batch of the students will be assessed through an online test before the classes begin in the\nfirst semester. Then the exercises for different classes will be tailored to the language needs of those students.\nIn general, these exercises are designed to enhance linguistic capabilities in comprehension, both reading and\nlistening, as well as improve the ability to structure and compose ideas in spoken and written communication. Many\nof them will be structured in the form of competitive games. Wherever necessary principles of English Grammar will\nbe discussed along with the nuances of technical writing. With respect to its content, some of the textual material\nand lectures  will focus on the relationship between Engineering, Humanities and Social Sciences.\nThe two semesters of Language and Writing Skills is administered in the form of two courses, each of one unit:\nNLN100 Language and Writing Skills\u2013I in the first semester and NLN101 Language and Writing Skills\u2013II in the\nsecond semester. These courses are coordinated by faculty from the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences\nand an S grade in both NLN100 and NLN101 is generally a prerequisite to register for most undergraduate courses\noffered by the department of HSS. Assessment of a student towards S grade in each of these courses would\ntypically be on the basis of attendance, participation and performance in the exercises. A student could also be\nprescribed self-learning exercises or additional practice sessions during vacations as requirement for securing S\ngrade. Student\u2019s involvement, during regular semester, would typically be two hours per week.

{"section": "3.4 Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility", "content": "There is increasing consensus worldwide that engineering ethics should be incorporated into the engineering\ncurriculum to provide students with an exposure to the kind of professional ethical dilemmas they might face on\nan individual basis as well as in the larger context of ethical aspects of technology development. Workshops,\ndiscussion/ debates, use of theatre-in-education, case-study based approaches, etc. are often used for illustration\nand discussion of engineering ethics. Such inputs could be provided in a stand-alone manner, integrated into\nexisting courses or both. The objective of this non-graded component is to sensitize students about Professional\nEthics and Social Responsibility (PESR) through a combination of the above-mentioned approaches, supplemented\nby discussion fora and supplementary materials, to help students to become ethical professionals. A student\nis required to complete minimum of 1 non-graded unit in this component through activities divided into 3 core\ncourses. The courses NEN110 and NEN111 together correspond to 0.5 non-graded unit and the course NEN300\nalso corresponds to 0.5 unit. Besides, the students can earn an additional unit through one of the two alternatives\nNEN212/NEN213 as discussed below. Thus, the courses under PESR are:\ni) NEN110 Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility \u2013 I (core)\nii) NEN111 Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility \u2013 II (core)\niii) One of the following two courses: (optional)\na. NEN212 PESR Workshops\nb. NEN213 PESR Projects\niv) NEN300 Case Studies in Professional Ethics (core)\n**Core Requirements**\nNEN110 and NEN111 are compulsory for all students, and these courses involve interactive sessions of a group\nof students with a resource person in the first and second semesters respectively. The student will earn 0.5 unit\nby getting S grade in both these courses.\nIn NEN300 Case Studies in Professional Ethics, every student will work on at least two case studies related to\nprofessional ethics, followed by discussions on the same, moderated by a resource person. The details on how\nto select the case studies and the mode of discussions and their evaluation would be decided by the concerned\nresource person. The student will earn 0.5 unit by getting an S grade in this course.\n**Activities for Additional NGU**\nThe students can choose to earn 1 more NGU under PESR by participating in any one out of a large variety of\nactivities relevant to the core themes of PESR. With the considerable amount of flexibility allowed in the choice\nof activities, each student desirous of earning this unit should be able to identify an activity of interest to him / her\nunder the purview of PESR. These activities have been divided into two broad categories, viz., (a) PESR workshops\n(b) PESR projects, each of which corresponds to a separate course number NEN212 and NEN213 respectively.\nAfter a student has got \u2018S\u2019 grades in NEN110 and NEN111, the student can register for NEN212 / NEN213.\n\u2018S\u2019 grade in any of these two courses will get the student 1 NGU.\n**NEN212 PESR Workshops**\nUnder NEN212 (PESR Workshops), students can participate in one workshop of 5 days duration if the workshop is\nheld in person. These workshops are generally organized on campus by NRCVEE soon after major examinations\nat the end of every semester. Alternatively, online workshops can be held with about 40 hours of engagement\nthrough 2-3 hour sessions during the semester or during vacation period. These workshops are organized by\nNRCVEE and would be conducted by resource persons from within or outside the Institute. These workshops could\nbe pertaining to any of the themes relevant to PESR and the in-person ones could be held during mid-semester\nbreak / summer / winter vacation. The students must follow the procedure announced by the faculty coordinator\nto register for a workshop. The \u2018S\u2019 grade for attending a workshop will be awarded only if the student attends all\nsessions of the workshop on all the days for its full duration.\n**NEN213 PESR Projects**\nUnder NEN213 (PESR Projects), the students can take up projects under the guidance of one or more faculty\nmembers to make positive contribution to campus life. This could include promoting wholesome practices on\ncampus such as:\n25\nCourses of Study 2024-2025 **Undergraduate Programme Rules**\n- ethical practices particularly among students through specially directed efforts;\n- peer assistance for the students in need of help academically or otherwise;\n- sustainable practices on campus like resource conservation, waste management, use of renewable\nresources and the like;\n- working on technology for a social cause etc.\nThis work could be done during a semester or mid-semester break or summer / winter vacation. The student\nmust submit a project proposal on the NGU portal, with explicit statement of deliverables, through his / her faculty\nsupervisor(s), for approval by the PESR coordinator. If the work is taken up in a team, each student\u2019s share of\nwork must be defined in the proposal. It is expected that each student puts in at least 40 hours of effort in the\nproject. On completion of the project, the students should submit a completion request online along with a report\nof the work done, again through the faculty supervisor, who should certify that each student has completed his / her\nshare of the deliverables and each student has put in at least 40 hours of work into the project.\nIf a student gets selected in one of the nation building initiatives organized by reputed organizations, the student\ncan identify a faculty supervisor who can be informed of the work done as part of these initiatives. On successful\ncompletion of the work, the student can apply on the NGU portal for earning NEN213 units through the faculty\nsupervisor, who can certify the completion of the concerned activity.\nTable 3.2 summarizes the requirements of the non-graded component on Professional Ethics and Social\nResponsibility.\n_**Table 3.2 : Summary of Requirements of the Non-Graded Component on Professional Ethics and**_\n|T|Table 3.2 : Summar|ry of Requirem|ments of the Non-Graded Comp Social Responsibility|ponent on Professional Et|thics and|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|**S.**<br>**No.**|**Course**|**Period of**<br>**Activity**|**Description**|**Requirement for \u2018S\u2019**<br>**grade**|**No. of**<br>**units**|\n|**A**|**Core Requirement**|**Core Requirement**|**Core Requirement**|**Core Requirement**|**Core Requirement**|\n|1.|NEN110<br>Professional<br>Ethics and<br>Social<br>Responsibility\u2013I|1stSemester|3-4 sessions of 2 hours each<br>with a resource person.<br>Theme of the sessions to be<br>announced by the faculty<br>coordinator|Participation in all the<br>sessions held|0.25<br>(both<br>courses<br>together)|\n|2.|NEN111<br>Professional<br>Ethics and<br>Social<br>Responsibility\u2013II|2nd Semester|3-4 sessions of 2 hours<br>with a resource person.<br>Theme of the sessions to be<br>announced by the faculty<br>coordinator|Participation in all the<br>sessions held|Participation in all the<br>sessions held|\n|3.|NEN300 Case<br>Studies in<br>Professional<br>Ethics|After 6th <br>semester:<br>during<br>vacation<br>or 7th/8th<br>semesters|Work on two case studies on<br>professional ethics; participate<br>in discussions moderated by a<br>resource person.|Participation in all the<br>sessions held along with<br>presentation of case<br>studies|0.5|\n|**B**|**Practical Activities for Additional NGU**|**Practical Activities for Additional NGU**|**Practical Activities for Additional NGU**|**Practical Activities for Additional NGU**|**Practical Activities for Additional NGU**|\n|4.|NEN212: PESR<br>Workshops|**If in-person:** <br>Mid-<br>semester<br>breaks\u2009/<br>summer\u2009/<br>winter<br>vacations.<br>**If online:** <br>can be held<br>during the<br>semester as<br>well|Participation in intense<br>ON-CAMPUS workshops<br>approved by Dean<br>Academics, of 5 days duration<br>if in-person and 40 hours<br>duration if online conducted<br>by professional resource<br>persons, with special<br>emphasis on themes related<br>to PESR.|\u2018S\u2019 grade to be awarded<br>only for attending<br>the workshop for full<br>duration.|1|\n26\n**Undergraduate Programme Rules** Courses of Study 2024-2025\n5.

{"section": "3.5 Communication Skills / Seminar", "content": "The objective of this non-graded component is to provide the students with an opportunity to develop their skills\nin preparing write-ups, making presentations, and reading / listening to others\u2019 write-ups / presentations. A student\nwould be required to earn 1 non-graded unit under this component between 5th and 8th semesters through any\nof the following:\n(i) Attending one of the topic specific seminar courses (XXQ301, XXQ302, etc.) introduced by the parent\nDepartment of a student (for example ELQ301 \u2013 Seminar on Embedded Systems \u2013 1 unit) or attending\na seminar course (XYQ301, XYQ302 etc.) offered by any other Department / Centre / School. These\ncourses would be non-credit electives, offered in each semester. These seminar sessions would be\nheld for two hours per week. Many such courses could run in parallel.\n(ii) Participating in optional seminars which may be part of regular courses; for example regular \u2018L\u2019 courses\ncan have an optional seminar component (e.g. ELL711 Optical Communications can have optional\nseminar component of 1 unit). This would, like any other seminar course, need to have seminar sessions\nof 2 hours duration every week for a whole semester. In such a case, a student should register for\nXXQ30y, and the course coordinator would send recommendations for \u2018S\u2019 grades to the Dean Academics,\nduly moderated by the Moderation Committee of the concerned Department / Centre / School.\n(iii) By participating in special workshops on Communication Skills approved by Dean Academics. The\nfaculty coordinator in charge of the workshop would submit a list of students who completed the activity\nwith 100% attendance in all sessions on all days of the workshop for award of \u2018S\u2019 grade in NQN301.\n(iv) By submitting documentary evidence of excellence in debating and / or writing as certified by faculty\nin-charge of these activities, to the Dean, Academics. In all such cases, the student should submit\ndocumentary evidence online, as detailed below:\nA student who wins first, second or third position in any event / competition conducted at inter-hostel\nlevel, by BRCA or by BSP or by BSW would qualify for this option. The event / competition must\n27\nCourses of Study 2024-2025 **Undergraduate Programme Rules**\nbe either a debate / declamation / extempore. Since many such events do not have certificates\nissued, the student must submit a letter signed by the warden or the president of the respective\nboard (in case of BRCA, president of the club would also suffice) stating the date, time, venue\nof the event / competition along with the number of participants and position secured. In case\nnumber of participants is less than 20, the event shall not be counted.\n- A student who performs as a compere for any of the Institute functions (only those listed in the\nInstitute calendar). The student will need to produce a signed letter from the faculty in-charge\nof the Institute function stating the student\u2019s role as compere. The letter must include the date,\ntime, venue and duration of the event. Any event lasting less than 1 hour will not be counted.\n- A student winning a technical paper presentation award during TRYST will need to submit a copy\nof the certificate and the abstract of the paper presented. Technical publications in Journals or\nConferences would also be considered, provided (i) the number of authors of the paper does not\nexceed 2 and (ii) the faculty member supervising the work certifies that the paper was written by\nthe concerned student.\nA minimum of three such documents certified by the faculty in charge of the Board / Club / Activity as mentioned above\nwould qualify a student to earn one unit of Communication Skills / Seminar. In each case, before recommending the\naward of non-graded units for the above activities, the faculty in charge of the Board / Club / Activity should keep in\nmind that a student engagement / effort (including preparations and the actual event) of about 40 hours would be\nnecessary for the award of one non-graded unit.\nIn cases of options (i), and (ii) above, the faculty member in charge of the course should ensure that the student\nhas 100% attendance in the seminars and has done a satisfactory task of his / her contribution to the course: the\nwrite-up, presentation, etc. before awarding an \u2018S\u2019 grade. These grades would be moderated by the respective\nDepartment / Centre / School. In case of unavoidable absence of up to 3 seminar sessions, appropriate compensation\nmechanism should be announced by the faculty member at the beginning of the course.

{"section": "3.6 Design / Practical Experience", "content": "The objective of this non-graded component is to give opportunities to students to learn in an informal setting.\nThis mode of learning, is often more effective than conventional lectures / laboratory work. Second and even\nmore important objective of this non-graded component is to inculcate design thinking among students and\nfacilitate them to gain some design immersion experience. Design / Practical Experience (DPE) component can\npromote learning by doing which does two important things: Firstly, it allows students to immerse themselves\nin the environment in which work is to be done, so that they can understand the values and expectations of the\ntarget beneficiaries. Secondly it enables a fresh look at problems, not only at the ways of defining them, but also\nat the ways to solve those including skill-sets that are required to address them. This approach signifies a shift\nfrom problem based learning (acquisition of knowledge) to project based learning (application of knowledge),\nin which the projects are grounded in problems outside the classrooms and laboratories, in everyday scenarios.\nThus, DPE bridges division between the curricular and the co-curricular components, and encourages the curiosity\nand involvement that arises from total absorption in a subject of interest.\nAs a part of this requirement, every student is expected to earn a minimum of three non-graded units of DPE to\ncomplete the degree requirements. To earn one unit of DPE, a student is expected to put in 28-42 hours of effort\nor 20 working days depending on the type of activity. To earn two units of DPE, a student needs to put in 56-84\nhours of effort or 40 working days depending on the nature of activity. These units can be earned in multiple\nways during the semester as well as during vacation and mid-semester breaks:\n- Courses with design focus without any regular graded credits, which are designated to give design /\npractical experience units.\n- Courses (core or elective) with optional design / practical experience component.\n- Summer / semester internships by students in R&D / Industry / Universities in India or abroad.\n28\n**Undergraduate Programme Rules** Courses of Study 2024-2025\n- Summer / winter / semester projects under the guidance of faculty of the Institute.\n- Participation in design /innovation projects by Innovation Center / CAIC, etc.\n- One time activity such as design /practical experience workshop /course /event during semester /\nvacation /mid-semester breaks, etc.\nDPE activities are not restricted to design of physical products but can also include system level design and\nexperience. For example a team of students who under the supervision of faculty in collaboration with an NGO,\nwould like to design a new financial inclusion system for marginalized section of population too can earn design /\npractical experience units.\nThe operational modalities of implementing the above-mentioned activities so that students can earn the required\nnon-graded units, are presented in the following paragraphs.", "url": "https://home.iitd.ac.in/uploads/PG%20Programme%20Rules/CoS%202024__PG%20Programme%20Rules%20Changed.pdf", "file": "ug_rules.json"}
