**1.** **POSTGRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS, REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES**
**1.1 Degree Requirements**
The detailed degree requirements for M.Sc., M.B.A., M.Des. M.Tech., M.S. (Research), M.P.P., Ph.D. degrees and
P.G. D.I.I.T. are listed in Table 1.
**1.2 Continuation Requirements**
The detailed requirements for continuation as a student in the respective programme for M.Sc., M.B.A., M.Des.
M.Tech., M.S. (Research), M.P.P., Ph.D. degrees and P.G. D.I.I.T. are listed in Table 11. Failure to maintain the
specified academic standing will result in termination of registration and the student’s name will be struck off the rolls.
The maximum permitted duration of each programme will be determined in terms of the number of registered
semesters. Any semester in which a student has registered for a course will be called a registered semester subject
to the following:
(a) Only the 1st and 2nd semesters of an academic year can be registered semesters. The summer semester
will not be considered as a registered semester.
(b) A semester when a student has been granted semester withdrawal or granted leave will not be considered
as a registered semester.
(c) The semester when a student is suspended from the Institute on disciplinary grounds will not be counted
towards the number of registered semesters.
The summer semesters falling in between the permitted registered semesters shall be available for earning credits.
After the student has registered for the maximum permissible number of registered semesters, the subsequent
summer semesters will not be available for earning credits.
**1.3 Minimum Student Registration for a Programme**
M.Sc., M.B.A., M.Des., M.P.P. or M.Tech. programme will not be run unless the number of students registered for
that programme is six or more. If the number of students left in a programme at the end of the 2nd semester is
less than four, the same programme may be looked into for temporary suspension by the Board of Educational
Research and Planning.
**1.4 Lower and Upper Limits for Credits Registered**
For students pursuing M.Sc., M.B.A., M.Tech., M.P.P. and M.S.(Research), the minimum registration requirements in
a semester are specified in Table 1. These minimum credit requirements are not applicable for graduating students
who require lower than the proposed minimum to graduate.
**1.5 Audit Courses for PG Students**
(a) M.Tech. / M.S.(R) / M.Sc. / M.P.P./ Ph.D. students are eligible for auditing a course at any time before completion
of the programme.
(b) A student can request for an audit grade in any course provided he / she is eligible to earn audit credits,
he/she is already registered for that course and it is not a core requirement of the student’s programme.
The request for auditing a course should be made on or before the last date for audit requests as defined
in the semester schedule.
(c) A student earns either an NP (audit pass) or an NF (audit fail) grade for an audit course. The audit pass (NP)
grade may be awarded if the student satisfies the attendance criteria specified for the course and he/she
has obtained at least a ‘D’ grade. The course coordinator can specify a higher criterion for audit pass at the
beginning of the semester. If either of these requirements is not fulfilled, the audit fail (NF) grade is awarded.
(d) Grades obtained in an audit course are not considered in the calculation of SGPA or CGPA.
(e) M.Tech., M.Sc., M.S.(R), M.P.P. and Ph.D. students can audit a course over and above their credit requirements,
as specified by the supervisor and SRC. Audited credits do not count for graduation requirements of PG
students.

Courses of Study 2024-2025 **Postgraduate Programme Rules**
(f) Non-credit core courses or core courses not considered for calculation of SGPA or CGPA for PG programmes
like Ph.D., MBA, M.Tech., M.P.P., M.S. (R) should not be referred to as audit courses. These courses should
be treated like similar core requirements for UG programmes such as Introduction to Programme. A student
can earn either a S or Z grade in such courses. The grade S indicates successful completion. A student has
to earn a S grade in such a course to meet the core requirements of a programme.
**1.6 Award of D.I.I.T. to M.Tech./MBA Students**
If a student after completing the maximum period available for the M.Tech. programme is not able to get the required
minimum DGPA of 6.0 with the minimum required credits for the respective programme, then he / she can apply
for a D.I.I.T. irrespective of whether the department/centre runs a Diploma programme or not. For the award of
D.I.I.T., the student must have earned a minimum of 36 valid credits with a minimum CGPA of 5.5. The request for
the award of DIIT must be made within 5 years of the date of joining the programme.
In case of M.B.A., DIIT shall be considered if at least 36 credits (9 courses from core and 3 courses from focus
module) +4 compulsory audit courses, have been completed satisfactorily with a minimum CGPA of 5.5.
**1.7 Regulations for Part-time Students**
Normally, part-time M.Tech. and M.S. (Research) students are expected to complete the degree requirements in
six semesters. In case of special circumstances, including extension of project work, the student can be allowed to
continue beyond six semesters but in any case he / she cannot extend registration beyond ten semesters excluding
summer semesters. In case of full-time students converting to part-time registration, the limit of six semesters will
continue to apply.
**1.8 Leave Rules for P.G. D.I.I.T., M.Des., M.Tech. and M.S. (Research)**
A full-time P.G. D.I.I.T., M.Des., M.Tech. or M.S. (Research) student during his / her stay at the Institute will be
entitled to leave for 30 days (including leave on medical grounds), per academic year. Even during mid-semester
breaks, and summer and winter vacations, he / she will have to explicitly apply for leave. He / she, however, may be
permitted to avail of leave only up to 15 days during winter vacation at the end of the first semester.
The leave will be subject to approval of the Head of Department/Centre / Programme/School Coordinator concerned
and a proper leave account of each student shall be maintained by the Department / Centre / Programme / School
Coordinator concerned.
**1.9 Assistantship Requirements**
A P.G. D.I.I.T., M.Des., M.Tech. or M.S. (Research) student irrespective of the source of assistantship, must attend
at least 75% of classes in each course in which he / she is registered. In case his / her attendance falls below 75% in
any course during a month, he / she will not be paid assistantship for that month. Further, if his / her attendance again
falls short of 75 % in any course in any subsequent month in that semester, his / her studentship and assistantship
will be terminated. For the above purpose, if 75% works out to be a number which is not a whole number, the
immediate lower whole number will be treated as the required 75% attendance.
The students are expected to put in 8 hours per week towards the work assigned by the Institute. Continuation
of assistantship in a subsequent semester would be conditional to satisfactory performance of the assigned
work and a SGPA of 7.0 or more (relaxed to 6.75 for SC/ST and PH students registered in M.Des., M.Tech. and
M.S. (Research) programmes).
**1.10 Summer Registration**
Summer semester registration for PG students is admissible. M.Tech./M.S.(R)/M.Des./M.P.P. students will be
allowed to register for maximum of one course (upto 4 Credits) and M.B.A./M.Sc. students upto 2 courses in
the summer. Summer semester registration for PG students is permitted only when a student would graduate
on completion of the courses registered in summer, and it is recommended by DRC / CRC. For projects, in
case X grade is awarded in the second semester, the student would be expected to register during summer for
completion of the project. Normally regular courses would not be offered during summer semester. Courses
can, however, be offered by Departments / Centres / Schools for taking care of special situations subject to the
availability and consent of faculty.

**Postgraduate Programme Rules** Courses of Study 2024-2025
**1.11 Master of Science (Research) Regulations**
The M.S. (Research) programme will comprise of 15 credits of the course work and 36 credits of the research
work. The 15 credits of course work should not include any component of minor project. In the first semester,
the student has to register for a minimum of 09 and a maximum of 15 credits. In the first semester, the part-time
students can only register for course work with minimum and maximum limits of 3 and 12 credits, respectively.
The course work must be completed by the end of third semester; otherwise the registration of the student will
stand cancelled.
The larger project component gives the student an opportunity to conduct in-depth investigation on a topic of
his/her interest. The project will be monitored by the Student Research Committee (SRC) and the students will
have to register for thesis (project course no. xxD895, ‘xx’ is department / school code) for 36 credits. An ‘X’
grade is awarded at the end of each semester until the project work gets completed and the thesis is written.
Nominally the M.S.(R) programme is expected to take 4 semesters (excluding summer). Upon completion of
project work, a thesis is written that is evaluated by one internal and one external examiner. Upon satisfactory
recommendations from the examiners, the thesis defense can be conducted before a committee. Conversion
to Ph.D. is also possible. For further details, see the “Rules and Regulations for Master of Science (Research)
Programme” booklet.
**1.12 Migration from one PG programme to another PG Programme of the Institute**
Provision exists for the PG students of the Institute to move from (i) M.Tech. / M.S.(R) to Ph.D., (ii) M.Tech. to
M.S.(R), and (iii) M.S.(R) to M.Tech. as per details given in the table below:
|Col1|M.Tech./M.S.(R) to Ph.D.|M.Tech. to M.S.(R)|M.S.(R) to M.Tech.|

Full-time M.Tech. and M.S.(R) students of IIT Delhi interested in joining the Ph.D. programme within two years of
completion of their M.Tech. / M.S.(R) will be granted waiver of residency period. The course work requirements can
be made up by either additional credits (6 credits as per present norms) taken during their M.Tech. / M.S.(R) period
(over and above their minimum Degree requirements) or in the summer semester (first or second) by identifying
courses. In all cases, the request for such credit transfer should be recommended by the concerned DRC / CRC / SRC
as relevant to their respective Ph.D. programmes.
**1.13 Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) Regulations**
The award of Ph.D. degree is in recognition of high achievements, independent research and application of
scientific knowledge to the solution of technical and scientific problems. Creative and productive enquiry is the
basic concept underlying the research work. In order to overcome any deficiency in the breadth of fundamental
training or proper foundation for advanced work, special preliminary or pre-Ph.D. courses are given by each
Department / Centre / School. These courses are given either by faculty members or by guest-speakers and
specialists in the field of research.
**1.13.1 Course requirements**
Candidates admitted to non-engineering departments and having a B.Tech. / M.Sc. / M.A. or equivalent degree are
required to complete a minimum of 12 credits. Relaxation up to 6 credits in the course work can be considered
for those with an M.Phil. degree. The minimum requirement of pre-Ph.D. Course Credits / work for Ph.D. student
admitted to an engineering department and having B.Tech. / M.Sc. Degree is 20 credits. The minimum requirement
of pre-Ph.D. Course Credits/work for Ph.D. student admitted to engineering department and having M.Tech. or
equivalent Degree is 6 credits. Individual Academic Units may recommend course work requirements above the
minimum requirements specified by the Institute.

Courses of Study 2024-2025 **Postgraduate Programme Rules**
M.Tech. or equivalent degree holders admitted to Ph.D. are required to complete a minimum of 6 credits. The
Departments / Centres / Schools may stipulate a larger number of credits in general or in specific cases. The
course requirement will be determined by the Department / Centre / School Research Committee (DRC / CRC / SRC)
on the recommendations of the supervisor after due consideration of the background of the student in relation
to the proposed topic of research. These courses can be prescribed from existing M.Tech. courses and / or
from special pre-Ph.D. courses including laboratory, seminar, foreign language, etc. Normally, no independent
study course will be allowed for Ph.D. students. The pre-Ph.D. course credits that contribute to the DGPA of the
Research Scholar can only be earned from regular lecture courses. In exceptional cases for Research Scholars
who join the Ph.D. programme after B.Tech. (or equivalent) degree, a maximum of one course may be allowed
having laboratory or programming content only. Such an exception would be allowed by the Dean, Academics
on recommendation of the SRC of the student and the corresponding DRC / CRC.
Further, in case a Ph.D. student having completed 15 credits is unable to complete the research at the Ph.D.
level for any reason whatsoever, he / she may be allowed to complete M.S. (Research) degree requirement as
per Institute rules.

**1.13.4 Attendance requirements for assistantship**
Any full time Ph.D. student receiving assistantship or scholarship irrespective of the source while pursuing course
work, must attend at least 75% of classes in each course in which he / she is registered. In case his / her attendance
falls below 75% in any course during a month, he / she will not be paid assistantship for that month. Further, if his / her
attendance again falls short of 75% in any course in any subsequent month in that semester, his / her studentship
and assistantship will be terminated. A research scholar after having completed the course work must attend to
his / her research work on all the working days and mark attendance except when he / she is on duly sanctioned
leave. The requirement of 75% attendance will apply as above, on daily attendance except in the cases where
longer leave has been duly sanctioned within the leave entitlement of the student. For the above purpose, if 75%
works out to be a number which is not a whole number, the immediate lower whole number will be treated as the
required 75% attendance.
All scholars who are offered assistantship are expected to put in 8 hours per week towards the work assigned by
the Institute. Continuation of assistantship in the subsequent semester would be conditional, subject to satisfactory
performance in the work assigned.
The above holds for Prime Minister’s Research Fellowship (PMRF) scholars as well. Additional rules governing
PMRF scholars may be announced from time to time.

(v) The progress of each candidate will be monitored by the DRC /CRC/SRC. For this purpose, the following
procedures will be followed:
(a) Ph.D. research work will be compulsorily given a course number, DTD 899 (Doctoral Thesis) for
all candidates across the Institute.
(b) The DRC / CRC / SRC Secretary / Ph.D. Coordinator will be coordinating the collection of progress
reports written and signed by the scholars and forwarded by the supervisors every semester.
(c) The supervisor(s) / SRC / DRC / CRC will evaluate the progress of the student every semester.
(d) X’ grade will be awarded if the progress is ‘satisfactory’ in that semester.
(e) If the progress is ‘unsatisfactory’, ‘U’ grade will be awarded. For the first appearance of ‘U’ grade,
a warning would be issued to the candidate by Dean, Academics. If his / her performance does not
improve after warning, the assistantship may be withheld.
