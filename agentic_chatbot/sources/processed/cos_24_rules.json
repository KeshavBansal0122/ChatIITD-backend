        "content": "IIT Delhi offers various Undergraduate, Post Graduduate and Ph.D. Programms at the undergraduate level, IIT\nDelhi provides science-based engineering education with a view to produce quality engineer-scientists. Every\nB.Tech. student needs to do compulsory foundation courses in the areas of basic sciences, humanities, social\nsciences and engineering sciences apart from departmental requirements in his/her core engineering discipline.\nDepartmental courses (core and electives) constitute about half of the total curriculum. Further, students do\nopen category electives to develop broad inter-disciplinary knowledge base or to specialize significantly in\nan area outside the parent discipline. Many activities are included in the undergraduate curriculum as nongraded core with a view to enhance the quality of learning. The curriculum provides broad based knowledge\nand simultaneously builds a temper for a lifelong process of learning and exploring. At present, IIT Delhi offers\n14 B.Tech., 3 Dual Degree (integrated B.Tech. and M.Tech.), and 1 B.Des. programmes.\nIIT Delhi also offers multiple Postgraduate Programmes (M.Sc./M.Tech./M.S.(Research)/M.Des./M.B.A./M.P.P./M.A./\nPh.D.) through its Departments, Centres, and Schools. Currently, there are 37 M.Tech., 8 Interdisciplinary M.Tech., 18\nM.S.(R.), 6 M.Sc., 1 M.Des., 3 M.B.A. (including part time), 1 M.P.P., 1 PG Diploma, and 31 Ph.D. programmes offered\nby different academic units. In addition, there are 2 joint Ph.D. and 1 joint PG Diploma programmes being offered in\ncollaboration with partner institutions. The Institute has multiple courses at appropriate levels to cater to the academic\nrequirements of the Postgraduate students. New courses are also being continuously added to the existing pool of PG and\nPre-Ph.D. courses. At the postgraduate level, students are also encouraged to look beyond their area of specialization\nto broaden their horizons through open electives and self-learning.\nThe medium of instruction in the Institute is English.\nThe Institute follows a semester system. An academic year typically runs from July through June next year and is\nessentially comprised of two semesters. Typically, the 1 [st] semester starts in the last week of July and ends in the 1 [st]\nweek of December; the 2 [nd] semester starts in the 1 [st] week of January and ends in the 2 [nd] week of May. Additionally, the\nsummer semester which starts in the 3 [rd] week of May and ends in the 2 [nd] week of July, is utilized in some exceptional\ncases. Detailed schedule is given in the Semester Schedule that is made available before the start of each semester.",

Major Project. The minimum marks for award of \u2018D\u2019 grade is 30 %. However, individual course coordinators\nmay set a higher marks requirement.\n**E** and **F** grades\nA student who has scored at least 20% aggregate marks in a subject can be awarded an \u2018E\u2019 Grade. The Course\nCoordinators are, however, free to enhance this limit but should keep the percentage about 10% less than the\ncut-off marks for \u2018D\u2019 Grade. The Course Coordinators can also specify any additional requirements (to be specified\nat the beginning of the Semester) for awarding \u2018E\u2019 Grade.

(Please see\n2.10 for definitions)\n**I** grade\nAn \u2018I\u2019 grade is temporarily awarded to a student on his/her request to denote incomplete performance in L (lecture),\nP (practical), V (special module) category courses. Requests for \u2018I\u2019 grade should be made at the earliest but not\nlater than the last day of major tests. An \u2018I\u2019 grade is awarded in case of absence on medical grounds or other\nspecial circumstances, before or during the major examination period, provided the student has met the attendance\ncriterion of the course. Attendance in the course for which \u2018I\u2019 grade is being sought will be certified by the course\ncoordinator of the course.\nThe course coordinators can instruct all students awarded \u2018I\u2019 grade as well as \u2018E\u2019 grade to appear for a common\nre-major test. All evaluation requirements for such students in the corresponding course(s) should be completed\nbefore the end of the first week of the next semester. Upon completion of all course requirements, the \u2018I\u2019 grade is\nconverted to a regular grade (A to F, NP or NF).\n**NP** and **NF** grades\nThese grades are awarded in a course that the student opts to audit. Only elective courses can be audited. Auditing\na course is allowed until a date stipulated in the semester schedule. The audit pass (NP) grade is awarded if the\nstudent\u2019s attendance is above 75% in the class and he/she has obtained at least \u2018D\u2019 grade. The course coordinator\ncan specify a higher criterion, at the beginning of the semester, for audit pass. If the stipulated requirements are\nnot fulfilled, the audit fail (NF) grade is awarded. The grades obtained in an audit course are not considered in the\ncalculation of SGPA, CGPA or DGPA. However, for undergraduate students, the credits will be counted in total\nearned credits in the respective category, subject to the maximum allowable limit for audit.\n**W** grade\nA \u2018W\u2019 grade is awarded in a course from which the student has opted to withdraw. Withdrawal from a course is\npermitted until the date specified in the Semester Schedule. Withdrawal from PG major project part 2 is allowed\nonly if he/she is given semester withdrawal.

Otherwise, the student will be awarded \u2018X\u2019 grade on a\npermanent basis and it will appear in his / her grade card. Further, the student will be required to register for the\ncourse in the next semester. The credits of the course will be counted towards his / her total load for the semester.\nIn case of Major Project Part-1, the student will not be permitted to register for Major Project Part 2 simultaneously\nas Major Project Part-1 is a pre-requisite for Major Project Part-2. A regular full-time student can be awarded \u2018X\u2019\ngrade only once in a course, other than the summer semester. A part-time M.Tech. student is permitted a maximum\nof two X-grades in the Major Project Part-2.\n**S** and **Z** grades\nThe \u2018S\u2019 grade denotes satisfactory performance and completion of a course. The \u2018Z\u2019 grade is awarded for noncompletion of the course requirements, and if it is a core course, the student will have to register for the course\nuntil he/she obtains the \u2018S\u2019 grade. The specific courses in which \u2018S\u2019 or \u2018Z\u2019 grades are awarded for undergraduate\nstudents are:\n(i) Introduction to Engineering and Programme\n(ii) Language and Writing skills\n(iii) NCC / NSO OOo / NSS\n(iv) Professional Ethics and Social Responsibility\n(v) Communication Skills / Seminar\n(vi) Design / Practical Experience\nBesides, summer / winter internships in some PG programmes are also awarded S / Z.",

Attendance Records of all students for each course will be\nmaintained.\nThe Course Coordinator will announce the class policy on attendance with respect to grading etc., at the beginning\nof the semester. This shall be done keeping in mind the importance of classroom learning in the teaching-learning\nprocess. Once the class attendance policy has been made clear to all the students registered for the course, the\nCourse Coordinator will implement the same in totality.\nFor the purpose of attendance calculation, every scheduled practical class will count as one unit irrespective of\nthe number of contact hours.\nAttendance record will be maintained based upon roll calls (or any equivalent operation) in every scheduled lecture,\ntutorial and practical class. Students are required to strictly adhere to and comply with any method or device\nemployed by the Course Coordinator / Instructor for purpose of Attendance Recording. Failure to do so may call for\ndisciplinary action. The course coordinator will maintain and consolidate attendance record for the course (lectures,\ntutorials and practicals together, as applicable).\nA Course Coordinator may choose any one or more of the following as attendance policy.\n(a) The Course Coordinator can assign 10% of the total marks to surprise quiz(zes). If attendance of\nthe student is greater than 90%, result of the best three quizzes will be considered, else average\nof all quizzes will be considered.\n(b) The Course Coordinator can allocate specific marks for participation in discussions in the class on\na regular basis.\n17\n(c) If a student\u2019s attendance is less than 75%, the student will be awarded one grade less than the actual\ngrade that he/she has earned. For example, a student who has got an A grade but has attendance less\nthan 75% will be awarded an A (-) grade.\n(d) A student cannot get NP for an audit course if his/her attendance is less than 75%.\nThe Course Coordinator can implement any other attendance policy provided the policy is approved by the Dean,\nAcademics.\nAttendance statistics will also be used in the following way:\n(a) If a student\u2019s attendance is less than 75% in more than two courses without any valid reason in a\nsemester, he/she will be issued warning and put under probation. If this is repeated, he/she will not be\nallotted a hostel seat in the next semester.\n(b) If a student\u2019s attendance is less than 75% in any course or CGPA is less than 7.0, then he/she will not\nbe eligible to hold any position of responsibility in the hostel/institute in the next semester.\n18",
